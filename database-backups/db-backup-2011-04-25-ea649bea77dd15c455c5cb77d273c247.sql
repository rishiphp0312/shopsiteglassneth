Based in the textile city Jaipur (Sanagner), Shilpi has been a successful craft based business using traditional techniques of hand block printing and embroideries. Founded by the traditional textile printer from Sanganer ,Brij Udaiwal, the company focuses on providing employment to 85 odd units dealing in hand-block printing, hand embroidery and stitching and which are located in Jaipur, Sanganer, Bagru and near by places. The company treats every craft person as the original creator of the design and the process because he is the one who knows his job well and has been doing it since ages and thus can create things which are truly his own creations. Thus every craft person in Shilpi is a Shilpkar. Shilpi Handicraft has a team of designers who regularly strive at providing latest trends and know how to the craft persons in order to inculcate the innovation amongst them. Also they emphasize on constantly experimenting and innovating, especially with modern colors and patterns to see how they could be applied to the craft. Mr. Brij Udaiwal is a National Award Winner (year1991) and over the years he has been actively working for the up-liftment of craftsmen by running various educational and vocational training centers. He is also energetically involved in the developments which are taking place regarding the future of hand-block printing in Sanganer. As part of its policy, Shipi has adopted various units which depend directly or indirectly for work. These units work in coordination with different subsidiaries of Shilpi Handicrafts ( Shilpi ,Prakhya, Weave N Prints, Pugmarks and Shilpi Sansthan) which are dealing in fabrics, handicrafts, garments and accessories, gifts etc. The company is currently venturing into retailing and service sector and thus holds its promise of promoting crafts and craftsperson","1","durga","","","","","","3","1","2010-11-21 21:16:28","0","0","","","0","","","","1","","","","0","0");

One gets the sense of being caught in a time warp as camel drawn carts, laden with logs of shesham and bales of fabric, sashay their way down chaotic dusty streets, enabling with every step the metamorphosis of their cargo into gorgeously hued hand block printed textiles.    The block-printed cottons of Jaipur have been renowned for their exquisite pattern, and coloring for at least two hundred and fifty years. Traditional prints favored greatly by the Mughal Emperors and their imperial courts, featured delicate floral sprays, spaced evenly on a white, pastel blue or yellow ground of fine cotton. While designing our collection of home furnishings it has been our endeavor to fuse traditional flavor with a good dose of modern aesthetic sensibility.    The tradition of hand block printing has continued to exist on a parallel universe, stubbornly resistant to industrialization, and is to this day practiced without the aid of mechanization or computerization. It is this defiant indifference to mechanization that gives block printing the aura of a pure craft form and makes block printed textiles so esteemed. Traditionally these textiles played an integral part of village life. However, with the introduction of mill prints and easy to maintain wash and wear synthetics, these textiles are gradually losing their appeal to the village consumer. It is only a growing appreciation of this craft in urban and export markets that is keeping this ebbing craft alive.","2","sanganer","welcome","Paypal","By courier","N/A","Thanks for visiting our store.","3","1","2011-04-04 05:45:26","0","0","","2011-01-20 13:28:28","0","","","","1","","","","0","0");

I said I had not, and desired he would explain to me what he meant by such an appellation applied to a mortal creature. He told me, that sometimes, though very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family with a red circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was an infallible mark that it should never die. The spot, as he described it, was about the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of time grew larger, and changed its color; for at twelve years old it became green, so continued till twenty-five, then turned to a deep blue; at forty-five it grew coal black, and as large as an English shilling, but never admitted any further alteration. He said these births were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs of both sexes in the whole kingdom, of which he computed about fifty in the metropolis, and among the rest a young girl born about three years ago. That these productions were not peculiar to any family, but a mere effect of chance; and the children of the struldbrugs themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the people.\n    \n<a href=\"http://geablessvapa.comoj.com/article.php?article=471616\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heavy equipment business</a>\n<a href=\"http://geablessvapa.comoj.com/article.php?article=186903\" rel=\"nofollow\">John deere 450h</a>\n<a href=\"http://geablessvapa.comoj.com/ctg.php?category=2&amp;page=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Burris equipment</a>\n<a href=\"http://geablessvapa.comoj.com/article.php?article=527555\" rel=\"nofollow\">Model excavators</a>\n<a href=\"http://geablessvapa.comoj.com/article.php?article=560259\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heavy equipment names</a>","0","0","Opera/9.00 (Windows NT 5.1; U; ru)","","0","0");

Everyone seems to feel the pull to play around and haul out some creative lies on April Fool&#8217;s Day. The swath of pranks may only be outweighed by groaning about the day on Twitter.  We abstained on WPCandy this year, though we did catch a few folks in the WordPress community happy to carry on the proud internet tradition of trying to make people believe in things that aren&#8217;t true.</p><p>Come to think of it, April Fool&#8217;s Day on the internet might not be very different from every other day on the internet.</p><p>In any case, we&#8217;ve gathered up the WordPress pranks we caught on to in the post below, just after the jump. If you caught something we missed, please share it in the comments. While you&#8217;re there, why don&#8217;t you weight in on April Fool&#8217;s Day pranks: are they worth a chuckle or a waste of your time?</p><p><span id=\"more-16523\"></span></p><h3>Page.ly announces launch of Dog.ly and Cat.ly</h3><p><a href=\"http://blog.page.ly/2011/04/wordpress-for-pets/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16527\" title=\"Dog.ly prank (banner)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/04/doglywpfordogsprank.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"186\" /></a></p><p>Joshua Strebel started the pranks off early this morning with the <a title=\"Page.ly announcement prank\" href=\"http://blog.page.ly/2011/04/wordpress-for-pets/\">announcement</a> of Dog.ly and Cat.ly, or a &#8220;WordPress service for pets&#8221;. According to their press release, &#8220;With so many rabid pet owners opening Twitter accounts, creating Facebook pages and even writing blogs, a solution was needed to take some of the pressure off.&#8221;</p><p>Can&#8217;t really argue with them there.</p><p>My favorite part of the fake press release is where they discuss the biggest tweaks to the WordPress admin:</p><blockquote><p>Major changes to the interface include a new <strong>PawFriendly<sup></sup> editor</strong> and translation on the fly, allowing dogs to use their familiar barks and cats to purr incessantly until something appears on the page.</p></blockquote><p>You can enjoy the fun on their <a title=\"Page.ly announcement prank\" href=\"http://blog.page.ly/2011/04/wordpress-for-pets/\">blog</a>.</p><h3>WordPress.com Stats trick users with a traffic spike</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16529\" title=\"WordPress.com Stats prank\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/04/wpcomstatsprank.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"249\" /></p><p>Here&#8217;s one that will take you from excitement, to cold realization, to a knowing smile: reports have come in that WordPress.com Stats users today were treated with an apparent traffic spike, though only in appearance (see the image above for an in-Dashboard example, provided by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/spigot/status/53878590336536576\">@spigot</a> on Twitter).</p><p>As long as your daily emotional highs and lows don&#8217;t depend on your traffic counts, this one shouldn&#8217;t have bothered you. In other words, this prank crushed my soul today.</p><h3>Sucuri Security vulnerability prank brings attention, few laughs</h3><p><a href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2011/04/serious-security-vulnerability-on-wordpress-3-x-remote-command-execution.html\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10597\" title=\"Sucuri logo\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2010/12/sucurilogo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"62\" /></a></p><p>Unfortunately this one falls in the &#8220;jokes that didn&#8217;t bring much joyous laughter today&#8221; category. The post has been <a href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2011/04/serious-security-vulnerability-on-wordpress-3-x-remote-command-execution.html\">redacted</a>, but originally described a WordPress backdoor planted in a non-existent WordPress file. A WPCandy <a href=\"http://voodoopress.com/2011/04/securi-net-april-fools-folly-wp-3-x-is-not-vulnerable/\">reader</a> provided a quote of the original post:</p><blockquote><p>Btw, we have not reported this to WordPress yet, because we think that it is not just a bug, but a careful planted backdoor (probably by Matt, their lead developer). We will explain it in details (yes, full disclosure). We are also calling all WordPress users to get together and sue WordPress.org, Automattic and everyone else involved.</p></blockquote><p>After a brief spurt of reactions in the comments and on Twitter, Sucuri pulled the prank and apologized for the inconvenience.</p><h3>Free Mystique theme adds unicorns to post comments</h3><p><a href=\"http://digitalnature.ro/projects/mystique/#comment-14552\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16528\" title=\"Unicorns prank (banner)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/04/unicornsinthemeprank.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"126\" /></a></p><p>It seems Mystique, a free theme from <a href=\"http://digitalnature.ro/\">Digital Nature</a>, added unicorns to the theme&#8217;s comment threads today. The method used was <a href=\"http://digitalnature.ro/projects/mystique/#comment-14558\">explained</a> in a comment on their blog, along with a number of other <a href=\"http://digitalnature.ro/projects/mystique/#comment-14552\">confused</a>, annoyed users. It&#8217;s probably fair to chalk this one up to more fizzle than fun, as well.</p><h3>Anything we missed?</h3><p>If you caught a WordPress prank, or even a great April Fool&#8217;s Day prank that you enjoyed, chime in and share with us in the comments.

2011</p></div>\n<p>I&#8217;m Nick Ohrn and I&#8217;m one of the co-organizers for the Seattle WordPress meetup as well as WordCamp Seattle. Jeff has graciously allowed me to write an article for WP Tavern about WordCamp Seattle and why you should go.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll cut straight to the chase &#8211; <a href=\"http://wordcampseattle.org/\">WordCamp Seattle 2011</a> is going to be amazing. First, we already have a vibrant and thriving community of WordPress users and developers in Seattle. Our <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/SeattleWordPressMeetup/?a=mu_ukprbho0m8\">monthly meetup has 300+ members</a> and the March meeting had 90+ actual attendees.</p>\n<p>Next, WordCamp Seattle 2011 features two keynote sessions that are going to knock people&#8217;s socks off. The opening day keynote is by <a href=\"http://wordcampseattle.org/speaker/scott-berkun/\">Scott Berkun of Automattic</a>. Scott will be talking about the WordPress.com product, how Automattic decides what features go into WordPress.com and eventually make there way into the self hosted version of WordPress and how a distributed company like Automattic works on a practical level.</p>\n<p>The end of day keynote session will be an interview session with <a href=\"http://wordcampseattle.org/speaker/alex-king/\">Alex King of Crowd Favorite</a>, an early WordPress contributor and amazing business man. I&#8217;ll be conducting the interview on stage (similar to the SxSW fireside chat format) and we&#8217;re going to be discussing how he came upon WordPress, what he thinks of the WordPress community, how he sees open source work evolving, what the deal was with WP Help Center and more. It&#8217;ll be a can&#8217;t miss.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a ton of awesome content lined up for the rest of the day. I&#8217;m not going to delineate the speakers in this post (but you should check out the <a href=\"http://wordcampseattle.org/agenda/\">schedule</a>) but I know a lot of them personally and am very excited to learn new and interesting things.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on the fence about WordPress Seattle and you think you can make it, I highly recommend you do so. We dropped the ticket prices because we have garnered a lot of support from sponsors across the industry, so you can get in for <strong>$30</strong>. If you can make it, I highly suggest <a href=\"http://wordcampseattle.org/registration/\">buying a ticket</a> and joining us as we make this one of the best WordCamps ever.</p>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordcamp-montreal-2011-looking-for-speakers\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WordCamp Montreal 2011 Looking For Speakers\">WordCamp Montreal 2011 Looking For Speakers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/buy-my-wordcamp-chicago-ticket\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Buy My WordCamp Chicago Ticket\">Buy My WordCamp Chicago Ticket</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordcamp-columbus-looking-for-more-speakers\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WordCamp Columbus Looking For More Speakers\">WordCamp Columbus Looking For More Speakers</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/H9quQHhlLtQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Apr 2011 10:05:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPCandy: Fill out your own bracket for WPCandys Theme Madness\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16008\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wpcandy/~3/qfxGqBzr5jQ/wpcandy-theme-madness-2011\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5665:\"<p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16008\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16496\" title=\"WPCandy Theme Madness 2011 (teaser)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/thememadness-teaser1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"240\" /></a></p><p>If you&#8217;re a fan of March Madness, you may be bummed seeing that this year&#8217;s days of filling out brackets and anxiously awaiting winners are coming to an end soon. We have just the thing for you. Throughout the month of April we will be running our own madness: WPCandy Theme Madness 2011!</p><p>Theme Madness is a competition of our own creation, where various WordPress theme shops will face off head to head each week to ultimately win the coveted <em>WPCandy trophy </em>and, ultimately, <strong>worldwide fame and superstardom</strong>.</p><p>Before the games begin we are accepting bracket submissions <a title=\"Submit your WPCandy Theme Madness 2011 Bracket\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/theme-madness\">over here</a>, so head on over and fill out yours so you can play along:</p><p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/theme-madness\">Fill out and submit your WPCandy Theme Madness bracket!</a></p><p>We&#8217;ll be starting the games up on April 11, at which point the fun will really begin. We have more details on Theme Madness and how it will work after the jump (as well as a picture of the trophy!), so be sure to click through.</p><p><span id=\"more-16008\"></span></p><h3>Wait wait waitwhat&#8217;s this all about?</h3><p>In short, this month we&#8217;re running Theme Madness 2011 at WPCandy. This means:</p><ul><li><span>64 WordPress theme shops will be facing off, head to head, to find out just who the most beloved theme shop is. Each match will consist of a period of voting, where users and fans will decide the winner themselves.</span></li><li><span>You can fill out a <a title=\"Submit your WPCandy Theme Madness 2011 Bracket\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/theme-madness\">Theme Madness 2011 bracket</a> and compete with other WPCandy readers for <strong>total bracket domination</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the end, the winning team <strong>and</strong> the winning bracket will be awarded a <em>hand made</em> WPCandy trophy, pictured below. </span></li><li><span>Hopefully we&#8217;ll all have a good deal of fun!</span></li></ul><p>And yes, the trophy below is <em>legit</em>:</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16493\" title=\"You could win a hand made WPCandy trophy!\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/wpcandytrophy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"395\" /></p><p>Participation in the bracket competition is completely free, just head over and <a title=\"Submit your WPCandy Theme Madness 2011 Bracket\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/theme-madness\">fill out your bracket</a> to participate. You can also <a title=\"Full size Theme Madness Bracket\" href=\"http://wpcandy.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/theme-madness-2011-bracket.pdf\">download a full size</a>, logo-filled version of the brackets. We are limiting it to one bracket per person, so choose the winners wisely.</p><p>After you&#8217;ve filled out your bracket, I would encourage you to consider the <a title=\"Power WPCandy and the WordPress Foundation in April 2011\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/is/powered/for-april-2011\">$5/month option</a> for powering WPCandy. We love the support, and during April we will also be sending all new $5 subscriptions straight to the WordPress Foundation. So you can support WPCandy and WordPress itself. I don&#8217;t even know how many <em>wins</em> that is, but it&#8217;s at least a handful or two.</p><h3>The competitors</h3><p>What&#8217;s a month of madness without theme companies to compete with one another? The small image below will bring you to a <a href=\"http://wpcandy.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/theme-madness-2011-bracket.pdf\">PDF containing the full bracket</a> with everyone on it. Have a look and then be sure to fill out your own bracket to join in the fun.</p><p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.s3.amazonaws.com/resources/theme-madness-2011-bracket.pdf\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16499\" title=\"Small version of full bracket with logos\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/brackets-big-small.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"367\" /></a></p><p>Each match between theme shops will be decided by the noise fans make, both in a poll and on Twitter. Social weight can swing any which way, so don&#8217;t necessarily go thinking that the biggest shops will win. It&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s game!</p><p>Finally, a few disclaimers:</p><ul><li><span>All of the theme shops in the competition are GPL compatible (as of March 2011), though not every theme shop in existence is listed. Sorry for anyone left out, but we had to make cuts somewhere. (There&#8217;s always 2012!)</span></li><li><span>Bracket groupings themselves are fairly arbitrary, though seeding was done deliberately. </span></li><li><span><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/arae\">Ashley</a> made the mint trophies herself, which I have to mention or face immense amounts of pain. The trophy is pretty awesome, right?</span></li></ul><p>So what does everyone think? Which shops will end up in the in the final four? Who will win?

A noble endeavor, <em>if I do say so myself</em>. In regards to selling and moving on from WPVibe, Armeda said:</p><blockquote><p>WPVibe was never considered something we were going to do for revenue. The thought for WPV was to make it a viable WordPress resource, and we&#8217;d like to see it live on and hopefully meet that potential. I&#8217;m running CubicTwo &amp; Sucuri which are revenue streams for me, and Dingman works for Userplane, our time has become very limited.</p><p>We launched it at the end of 2009, C2 and Sucuri from my side came in early 2010. They&#8217;ve taken off and unfortunately I can&#8217;t give the needed attention to WPV for it to grow as we&#8217;d like.</p></blockquote><p>Armeda also <a title=\"Dre Armeda\'s tweet\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/dremeda/status/52738130192760832\">mentioned</a> on Twitter that anyone interested in WPVibe can also contact him directly.</p><p>So who&#8217;s in the market for a WordPress blog like WPVibe&#8217;s?

Tapestry adds support for all the available <a title=\"Post Formats on the WordPress Codex\" href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats\">post formats</a>, which will be ideal for anyone wanting to do down the Tumblr-style of blog, and comes in a nice blue-ish colour. From the announcement post:</p><blockquote><p>Were also pleased to announce that this is the first of what will be many Tumblog-style child themes for Genesis. With the release of WordPress 3.1 which includes post formats, we want to take full advantage of the awesomeness that WordPress provides.</p></blockquote><p>Says Brian Gardner, who also goes on to mention in the comments:</p><blockquote><p>Believe it or not, this theme has been done for a few months now  was waiting for WP 3.1 to come out and the right time to launch.</p></blockquote><p>If you are interested in Tapestry and already a StudioPress customer, then you can grab a copy for just $24.95 or $79.95 if you need access to the Genesis Framework too.

At least, that&#8217;s the impression I get as I&#8217;ve routinely been receiving emails lately from people letting me know about the launch of their theme sorter. The newest one to launch which has over 500 themes from 19 sellers listed with a goal to reach over 1,000 by this summer is called <a href=\"http://themesorter.com/\">ThemeSorter</a>. ThemeSorter provides different ways to browse through their listing such as color, specific niche, ratings, styles, etc. </p>\n<p>Talk about an easy business model. There are so many commercial themes being developed by established companies with brand new commercial theme businesses opening shop every week that it makes sense to create a directory of sorts to try and make sense of everything. The directory has to be easy to browse, contain affiliate links to their respective theme authors and hope people go through you to purchase the theme. Special deals from those sellers wouldn&#8217;t hurt either. </p>\n<p>The question I have about all these different theme sorters is which one will gain critical mass? That is, which one will end up having a community of people or users that rate and review themes similar to customers reviewing items that have purchased from Amazon? Which one will be the go-to place that has the largest and most legit listing? I&#8217;ve heard many people request that there be a place similar to the WordPress.org theme repository but for commercial themes and these theme sorters seem to fit the bill although they don&#8217;t contain any files to download. They are informative only. </p>\n<p>If nothing else, these commercial theme aggregation sites make for a good place to get inspiration or find out what the latest designs are from the commercial theme ecosystem surrounding WordPress. How many of you have actually used one of these sites to purchase a commercial theme?</p>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-94-%e2%80%93-commercial-themes\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WPWeekly Episode 94  Commercial Themes\">WPWeekly Episode 94  Commercial Themes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/should-the-wordpress-support-forum-only-support-themes-from-the-theme-repository\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Should The WordPress Support Forum Only Support Themes From The Theme Repository?\">Should The WordPress Support Forum Only Support Themes From The Theme Repository?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/the-mojo-on-mojo-themes\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Mojo On MOJO Themes\">The Mojo On MOJO Themes</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/8P_70_M0sCY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Mar 2011 09:20:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPCandy: WordPress Workspaces: Pippin Williamsons standing desk\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16364\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wpcandy/~3/Re3brhCbkes/pippin-williamsons-wordpress-workspace\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6090:\"<p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16364\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16365\" title=\"Pippin Williamson\'s WordPress Workspace (teaser)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/pippinworkspace-teaser.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"240\" /></a></p><p>We all work with WordPress professionals every day.

Logitech Surround Sound speakers</h3><p>It is very rare for me to not have music blasting out of these while working. I swing back and forth from heavy metal, such as System of a Down and Static X to the epic movements of Hans Zimmer. They&#8217;re getting really old, but still do the job pretty well.</p><h3>2. Just Mobile iPhone 4 Stand (phone used as camera)</h3><p>One of my favorite purchases from ThinkGeek.com, this little stand keeps my iPhone clean, out of the way, and at the perfect angle for texting, reading, or what have you without ever lifting the phone.</p><h3>3. 24&#8221; widescreen HD monitor</h3><p>One of my two 24&#8243; monitors, this one is my dedicated web browser (Chrome) screen.</p><h3>4. Connected Land web cam</h3><p>Outdated when compared to the cameras in my phone, laptop, and iPad, but it&#8217;s gets the job done, even if a little pixelated.</p><h3>5. Apple Keyboard</h3><p>I&#8217;ll never use another keyboard, unless it&#8217;s a newer version (or simply newer in terms of use) of this one.</p><h3>6. 17&#8221; Envision LCD</h3><p>A relic from several years ago, this 17&#8243; baby holds my code editor (Notepad++) and sits right in the center of my desk for the perfect viewing angle when furiously typing away code.</p><h3>7. Logitech G5 gaming mouse</h3><p>It&#8217;s weighted. It has three levels of manually adjustable sensitivity. It has forward back buttons for tabbing through Notepad++ windows. And it&#8217;s awesome. Enough said.</p><h3>8. 2nd 24&#8221; Dell widescreen HD</h3><p>The newest addition to my screen collection, this is my Photoshop / FTP / Skype real estate.</p><h3>9. iPad 2 with blue SmartCover</h3><p>Brand spankin&#8217; new, the iPad doesn&#8217;t serve a lot of purpose on my desk, except to act as a dedicated Pandora machine. And a damn nice one at that.</p><h3>10. 15&#8221; Apple Cinema Display acting as dedicated wall clock, powered by 1st generation Mac Mini</h3><p>While obscenely silly, this is one of my favorite aspects of my workspace. The monitor is really old, the Mac Mini is really, really old, but together they make one sweet clock. Toad, just below the screen, has sort of become my workspace&#8217;s mascot as well.</p><h3>11. All sitting on hand made, solid rock maple standing desk</h3><p>My pride and joy. I built the desk by hand when I was a junior in high school. It is built out of solid rock maple (and believe me, the wood is very aptly named) and weighs more than you&#8217;d like to know, but it is also solid enough to take the weight of a car. The stringers (support arms between the legs) are connected to the 4&#8243; legs with hand-chiseled mortise-and-tenon joints. It all comes apart for easy transportation.</p><h3>The computer</h3><p>Custom built PC running Windows 7, dual video cards, 6-core AMD Phenom processor, 4 gigs of ram, and 300+ gigs internal storage with an additional 500 external.</p><hr /><h3>That&#8217;s all folks!</h3><p>And thats Pippin Williamson&#8217;s WordPress Workspace.

(Peep that beautiful, 100% WordPress-powered site.) I pre-ordered it forever ago, a fact that may surprise friends who know how little I cook, but I do love food and I was as interested in the pictures and the result of a detail-oriented and science-driven obsession with quality that goes all the way down <a href=\"http://modernistcuisine.com/printing-the-book/\">to the stochastic printing process</a> as the articles/recipes .</p>\n<p>The books are, in a word, stunning.

Thord is a veteran member of the WordPress community and over the past few years, we&#8217;ve seen him develop and release free themes, write a couple of books about WordPress and generally, just be a well rounded individual when it comes to the software. Those of us in the U.S. may not know him that well thanks to his location. Hopefully, this interview changes that.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve seen your name a number of times, especially during my short employment with Performancing.com. Can you give us a brief background as to who you are and where you call home?</em></p>\n<p>Home is where I am at the moment, which means the French Alps as I&#8217;m writing this. Most of the time it is Stockholm (capital of Sweden, Land of Kings), so we could call that my home.</p>\n<p>As for my background, well it started out with me not having enough money to print my magazine back in the 90s, so I figured I&#8217;d give this internet thing a go. I got started publishing sites (in Swedish) out of necessity, and from there on it became a slightly unhealthy obsession. I got tired of my Swedish website empire in 2005 and sold it off, started blogging about &#8220;new media&#8221; in English, and that kicked off a freelancing career, both as a writer for various blogs and online magazines and as a WordPress developer.</p>\n<p>Basically, I do what I want to do, wherever I want to do it. Isn&#8217;t the internet wonderful?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5198\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tdhme.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/tdhme-500x308.png\" alt=\"thords personal site\" title=\"tdhme\" width=\"500\" height=\"308\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5198\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thord&#039;s Personal Site</p></div>\n<p><em>What got you started and involved with theme creation with WordPress?</em></p>\n<p>I went from developing my own publishing software with my friends, to embracing open source. It all started with forum software actually, and the realization that open source was really rewarding as a publisher. That made me look to platforms such as WordPress, and I actually converted a fairly large website to 1.5, tagging everything with the Ultimate Tag Warrior plugin. It was pretty groundbreaking back then since the site wasn&#8217;t even remotely close to a blog.</p>\n<p>Every platform and system I&#8217;ve learned over the years has come out of necessity. I&#8217;m curious by nature, that helps, but I never dive into anything just for making a profit as a consultant or something like that. Those things usually follow by themselves anyway.</p>\n<p><em>What is the WordPress situation like in your part of the world? For example, do you have meetups local to your area?</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been slow going in Sweden actually, we had the first WordCamp in Stockholm last Autumn, hosted by yours truly obviously, at a museum which was pretty cool. There are some photos in the Flickr group if you&#8217;re interested. Before that there have been some local meetups and such, but usually when we meet it&#8217;s not WordPress only, so to speak. We do have the #wpbar events, which I founded along with some like minded enthusiasts and agencies, but that&#8217;s basically an excuse to get together, talk WordPress, and drink beer courtesy of sponsors.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5199\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wordcampstockholm.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wordcampstockholm.png\" alt=\"wordcamp stockholm\" title=\"wordcampstockholm\" width=\"406\" height=\"140\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5199\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordCamp Stockholm 2010</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s getting better though, with unconferences popping up everywhere, and WordPress as such have a really strong position in Sweden. Maybe that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s been a lack of dedicated events &#8211; it&#8217;s ever present anyway.</p>\n<p><em>What are your thoughts on the state of themes in the WordPress ecosystem e.g. parent themes, frameworks, etc?</em></p>\n<p>Well, first of all, branding a theme as a &#8220;framework&#8221; to me is nothing more than trying to ride the hype. Seriously, every theme is a possible framework the way these things work, surely more or less suited, but I find the term misleading. I do approve of the way themes are going though, being designed with enhancements and build-upons in mind from the start.</p>\n<p>I think parent and child themes are great, and I hope that the wordpress.org theme directory will improve when it comes to listing these. It&#8217;s in the works already, and some child themes are listed (although they need to be branded more clearly) already, so I&#8217;m pretty happy with that.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m less than thrilled about is the &#8220;premium&#8221; themes. First of all, I think the word &#8220;premium&#8221; is misleading, &#8220;commercial&#8221; is a way better choice, because there&#8217;s certainly nothing &#8220;premium&#8221; about a lot of the $69 themes. You wouldn&#8217;t believe how many emails I get each month asking me if I can help them fix this or that theme they bought. There are some truly excellent commercial themes out there, and I wish the theme designers all the best, but this part of the theme ecosystem doesn&#8217;t appeal to me at all.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I hope the roll-out of commercial themes on wordpress.com will speed up, with some general submission process soon. This invite only structure leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but hopefully that&#8217;s just Automattic trying to make sure that everything works the way it should.</p>\n<p>Finally, I&#8217;m a big believer that themes should be GPL, and luckily the community agrees with me, at least officially.</p>\n<p><em>One of the first books you wrote and published was called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smashing-WordPress-Beyond-Blog-Magazine/dp/0470684151/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1301334115&sr=8-1\">Smashing WordPress &#8211; Beyond The Blog</a>. Based on reports and feedback I read on Twitter, it was a smashing success. Can you tell us how the book came about and if it&#8217;s success will lead to a second edition?</em></p>\n<p>Smashing WordPress: Beyond the Blog, 2nd Edition will be published in April this year. There should be pre-orders and whatnot available on Amazon and other fine online retailers any day now. I&#8217;m really happy to have been able to do a second edition of the book, to WordPress 3.1 obviously but also because this one looks a lot better. As far as I know, Beyond the Blog was the first book in the Smashing book series, and the publisher have continued to improve the look and feel of the books.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it&#8217;ll be in full color this time around as well, which I&#8217;m happy with. Especially since I knew it from the start, which I didn&#8217;t when I wrote the first book. That&#8217;s why we were so shy on images in Beyond the Blog &#8211; full color wasn&#8217;t on the table until the end of the production.</p>\n<p>For more about my books, including the one I&#8217;m writing right now, check out <a href=\"http://tdh.me/books/\">http://tdh.me/books/</a> (shameless self promotion ends now).</p>\n<p>As for how it came to be, I wrote a blog post about WordPress as a CMS, which got some nice links and buzz. A while later my publisher (Wiley) emailed and asked if I wanted to write a book, and I said sure, sent an outline, and that was it basically. A few contracts Fedexed over the world, a small (compared to the ones I&#8217;m getting now at least) advance, and a truly hectic period of writing later, I could sit back knowing that I&#8217;d written my first book in English.</p>\n<p>Everything good that has happened to me in the last five years or so, professionally, have started with a blog post. That&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n<p><em>As I understand your latest entry into the print world is a new book entitled Smashing WordPress Themes. Can you provide us with a basic overview of what&#8217;s covered in this book?</em></p>\n<p>The idea with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smashing-WordPress-Themes-Beautiful-Magazine/dp/047066990X/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1301334163&sr=8-2-fkmr1\">Smashing WordPress Themes: Making WordPress Beautiful</a> is to teach the reader how to develop WordPress themes. As with Beyond the Blog, I&#8217;m starting at the basics, and build up with examples of sites you can do with WordPress, how you can solve the most common issues, and so on. Obviously the book covers things like template tags and conditional tags, but what I really think is the killer is how the reader can follow the development of several themes. My goal is to get the reader to understand the tools at hand, and I try to get the wheel&#8217;s spinning in his or her head. If the reader gets ideas for sites or themes when reading my Smashing WordPress books, I think I&#8217;ve succeeded.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5200\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/smashingwordpressthemes.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/smashingwordpressthemes.png\" alt=\"smashing wordpress themes book cover\" title=\"smashingwordpressthemes\" width=\"541\" height=\"205\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Smashing WordPress Themes Cover</p></div>\n<p>The table of contents, along with some other info about the book, is available here: <a href=\"http://tdh.me/books/smashing-wordpress-themes-making-wordpress-beautiful/\">http://tdh.me/books/smashing-wordpress-themes-making-wordpress-beautiful/</a></p>\n<p><em>If I were a beginner not only to using WordPress but also web development in general, do you think this book would be over my head?</em></p>\n<p>It might be. I usually say that if you know a bit of HTML and CSS, maybe can grasp PHP, then you can learn working with WordPress from both my books. It&#8217;s more a matter of your understanding of scripting languages (of the simpler kind) than how green you are. This one&#8217;s a tough one, I won&#8217;t tell you what an HTML tag is for example, so basic knowledge of that is necessary.</p>\n<p><em>The print world moves at the pace of a snail. While the book covers WordPress 3.0.1, is it still relevant with the release of WordPress 3.1?</em></p>\n<p>Sure is. Thankfully, the step from 3.0 to 3.1 wasn&#8217;t huge. I still get happy emails about the first edition of Smashing WordPress: Beyond the Blog, which definitely isn&#8217;t up to speed, so it&#8217;s not all about featuring the latest functions you can play with. Although that&#8217;s more fun, obviously.</p>\n<p>But yeah, it&#8217;s frustrating, this dead trees business! This isn&#8217;t the point and shoot of the web after all, which sometimes is a good thing, but not without its drawbacks when it comes to tech books. </p>\n<p><em>Last but not least, as a theme developer, I&#8217;ll provide you the opportunity to tell me what the future of themes are as we progress into 2011?</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid the future is more commercial themes and fewer truly great free themes. This makes me sad, actually, because I think it is hurting the WordPress platform. I hope that child themeing will take off since that could mean more options for end users. Other than that, we&#8217;ll get more settings, themes will get more advanced, and hence often less optimized. I know I come across as negative here, but these things concern me. Overall the theme ecosystem and the WordPress community is in great shape and I&#8217;m happy to be a part of it.

About a year or so ago I started looking into multi-WAN routers that would, at least, support two internet connections and failover to the other one, and as a bonus maybe provide some speed benefits as well. Here&#8217;s the story of that journey.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-37935\"></span></p>\n<p>After a ton of research I ended up with a Peplink, probably in part because <a href=\"http://peplink.com/\">their website</a> is the best organized designed of the vendors I found. I&#8217;m very lucky to access to two great internet providers in my building: <a href=\"http://web-pass.com/\">Webpass</a>, a local ISP which provides symmetric 100 Mbps (albeit shared with neighbors), and Comcast with DOCSIS 3.0 support (they sometimes market it as Extreme 50) which provides around 50-60 Mbps. Because the combined speed was above 50 Mbps put me as a &#8220;mid-sized business&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.peplink.com/balance/tech-spec/\">according to Peplink&#8217;s product line-up</a> and I ended up with a Peplink Balance 390 (which seems to be the same as the 380 on their website).</p>\n<p>First on the Balance 390, which I&#8217;ve used about a year and a half: it&#8217;s a really solid product. It did everything that was promised including the failover, has been rock-solid, and the Peplink-delivered firmware updates have made the interface significantly better since I bought it in December 2009 especially for router-centric things I like to do like have the DHCP reservations and naming. (The interface is significantly better than what I&#8217;ve used on Linksys and D-link routers before.) <strong>The 390 only had one downside: it&#8217;s incredibly loud.</strong></p>\n<p>Now as background I should caveat that I&#8217;m pretty sensitive to ambient noise, especially from computing devices. Over the years I&#8217;ve gone from 4 computers in my office to just a laptop I take with me, and when I moved one of the things I looked for was the closet with the ethernet patch panel and where all the connectivity came in was far away from where I&#8217;d work or sleep. I&#8217;ve stopped using devices before, like the Drobo, because they were too loud. (I think the Drobo still takes the cake.)</p>\n<p>But the &#8220;server closet&#8221; is actually the closet in my guest room slash TV room, so even though I was relatively shielded from the noise in there my guests were subjected to it, which was made worse because I had so much stuff in there the closet would get quite hot so I would usually leave the door cracked.</p>\n<p>Late last year I started minimizing everything in there to bring the noise, heat, and my electricity bill down. I went from a couple of switches daisy-chained together to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002TPFTA\">a single 24-port D-Link</a>. For network storage I&#8217;m a big fan of QNAP devices and have owned their 5, 6, and 8 drive versions. I had a <a href=\"http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=111\">TS-809U (rackmount, also really loud)</a> I shipped off to be an off-site backup, retired the old 5-drive, and standardized on a <a href=\"http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=108\">(pretty quiet) TS-639</a> with 6 1TB drives in RAID6 so about 3.6TB usable. Finally I replaced old desktop machines and Linux servers I had accumulated over the years with a <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macmini/\">single beautiful Mac Mini</a>. (Still planned is to replace old rackmount UPS with this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00429N19W\">much-quieter Cyberpower</a> and some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YFIRR6\">nifty liberators</a>.)</p>\n<p>But I was still stuck with the Balance 390 providing the lifeline of connectivity to the house and sounding like a plane taking off. However after <a href=\"http://forum.peplink.com/topic/noise-of-new-products\">a post on Peplink&#8217;s bbPress-powered forums</a> I decided to check out two of their new products, the Balance 30 and Balance 310, as I said:</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\"><blockquote><p>It looks like you guys have some new products that would be a little slower but adequete for my needs. I noticed on the comparisons that the 20/30 is a smaller and lighter than the 210/310, and they draw the same amount of power.</p></blockquote></div>\n<p>They responded &#8220;The 20/30/210/310 are all completely quiet because they don&#8217;t have a fan!&#8221; Awesome, we&#8217;re in business. But how about performance? Since I&#8217;m in a unique position of having three of their products in front of me, and their website is a bit confusing, I decided to do some rough but real-world tests of each product and found a pretty counter-intuitive results.</p>\n<p>As a background for the following benchmarks, I upgraded each device to the latest firmware (5.2.2), unplugged everything from the network, and plugged my laptop directly into the LAN port of each router and ran <a href=\"http://www.peplink.com/index.php?view=faq&id=111&path=19\">some speed tests as suggested by Peplink themselves</a>, which I <a href=\"http://forum.peplink.com/topic/peplink-30-wan-aggregation\">found on this thread</a>. Basically the tool just downloads some big files from Adobe, Apple, and Microsoft and tells you how long it took. The following table is the average of a few tests I ran for each while only having a single WAN link plugged in, then I tried some additional tests just on the Microsoft download paired with Comcast since that seemed to be the fastest possible, finally I plugged in both WAN links and kicked off multiple downloads at once and tried to observe the peak throughput. The absolute numbers aren&#8217;t as interesting, mostly the maximums. I basically wanted to test their assertion that &#8220;The ratings are derived from the actual performance (combination of sw and hw) and not limited by software.&#8221;</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" width=\"620\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\"></th>\n<td>Balance 30</td>\n<td>Balance 310</td>\n<td>Balance 390</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>List Price</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>$395</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>$1,495</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>$1,995</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Vendor-rated Throughput</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>50 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>50 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>170 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>USB 3G modem support</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>Yes</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>No</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>Yes</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Adobe Webpass</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>21.3 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>37.1 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>17.4 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Apple Webpass</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>22.1 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>36.6 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>18.7 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Microsoft Webpass</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>22.2 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>41.3 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>22.3 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Adobe Comcast</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>22.1 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>42.6 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>52.3 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Apple Comcast</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>21.6 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>44.3 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>46.7 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Microsoft Comcast</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>22.4 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>46.9 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>57.9 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Microsoft Comcast #2</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>31.3 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>47.2 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>57.3 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Observed CPU load</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>100%</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>100%</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>~35%</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"row\">\n<div>Comcast + Webpass  Microsoft Download</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<div>90.16 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>49.5 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<div>116.2 Mbps</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So the conclusions and things I discovered from these numbers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The 390 is the most powerful, it was able to handle 116 Mbps with some room to spare.</li>\n<li>The 310 interface would freeze up and become completely unresponsive as the transfer got higher. Though it did better than the 30 on the single-WAN tests, it completely fell over on the dual-WAN test. The 30 stayed responsive even when the CPU pegged at 100%.</li>\n<li>The 30 has <strong>bonus unadvertised gigabit</strong> LAN ports (the 310 has 10/100 Mbps ports) which surprised me because it seems <a href=\"http://www.peplink.com/balance/tech-spec/\">from their comparison chart</a> that you only get gigabit LAN ports starting with the 380.</li>\n<li>The 30 was able to peak just under 100 Mbps combining the two connections, which is not that far away from the 390, which is 5 times the cost. And it <em>crushed</em> the 310 which is 4x the cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now as for the <em>why</em> of these numbers, I don&#8217;t know, maybe Peplink could comment. This test was pretty unscientific, but I was able to recreate over and over again that plugged into the Balance 30 I got <strong>double the performance at a quarter of the cost</strong> of the 310, something I ended up repeating over and over because it was very counter-intuitive to me. Perhaps the 20/30 are just newer generation products and the 210/310 line will catch up in their next refresh, or after they clear out their existing inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>So in summary:</strong> Peplink is great, their 380 and above products are fantastic if you need the power and can put them someplace no one will hear them. The 210/310 is a rip-off and should be avoided. The Balance 30 performs above its ratings and I&#8217;d recommend it for anybody like me with multiple internet connections. The &#8220;Next Generation Broadband Ready&#8221; rating on the 210/310 appears to be incorrect.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve unplugged my 380 and now have my entire home network going through the Balance 30, and it&#8217;s as snappy as can be. One of these days I&#8217;ll play around with the 3G failover stuff. I can leave the door to my server closet closed now, and guests will sleep peacefully.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 27 Mar 2011 00:45:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPCandy: WordPress Community Links: Gold star cookie edition\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16337\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wpcandy/~3/9a4XMv_lHgI/gold-star-cookie-edition\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7857:\"<p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16337\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16341\" title=\"Five star communty links (teaser)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/fivestar-teaser.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"576\" height=\"247\" /></a></p><p>It&#8217;s time for another dose of community links, this time in delicious star cookie form.

let me start off by saying hello to everyone who has arrived to this post via the dashboard of their WordPress installation. Secondly, I&#8217;d like to personally thank Matt Mullenweg for not only adding WPTavern to the <a href=\"http://planet.wordpress.org/\">Planet WordPress Feed</a> but for adding WPCandy as well. It&#8217;s funny because I remember in 2009 when WPTavern was just getting started, <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/chances-of-wptavern-getting-into-dashboard\">I wrote an article</a> explaining why this site would never make it into the dashboard. Needless to say, my attitude and the times have changed. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5187\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wptaverninthedashboard.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wptaverninthedashboard.png\" alt=\"wptavern in the dashboard\" title=\"wptaverninthedashboard\" width=\"431\" height=\"218\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5187\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We Finally Made It In!</p></div>\n<p>For those of you brand new to WPTavern.com, my name is Jeff Chandler and this is a site focused on all things WordPress. On top of that, we also cover BuddyPress, bbPress, any project under the Automattic umbrella. You can get a sense as to what this site is about via my <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/about\">About page</a> but to make a long story short, this site exists as a place to find out what&#8217;s going on throughout the WordPress ecosystem. On this site, you&#8217;ll see interviews, links, quotes, and all sorts of content related to WordPress as well as Automattc.

The new look is nice, but the update came with other interesting features as well. Top of the list are new subscription options for themes, bonus themes when you purchase, an improved support section, and a new members area.</p><p>The new pricing model introduces memberships to WPZoom, which previously only offered individual theme purchases. Now memberships can be purchased for $199 plus $9/month for a standard membership, or $299 plus $19/month for a developer membership. Ciorici <a href=\"http://www.wpzoom.com/news/meet-the-new-version-of-wpzoom/#comment-11597\">says</a> both memberships will be guaranteed 1-3 themes per month. Individual themes can still be purchased for $69 or $149, standard and developer versions respectively.</p><p>Perhaps best of all, the new pricing structure includes a shiny new pricing page, which is <a title=\"WPZoom pricing page\" href=\"http://www.wpzoom.com/pricing/\">worth a gander</a>.</p><p>The new site was designed by <a title=\"Web designer Jonatan Flores\" href=\"http://jonatanflores.com/\">Jonatan Flores</a>, a web designer in Buenos Aires. The redesign comparison image is just after the jump.</p><p><span id=\"more-16295\"></span></p><p>Below you can see the old design compared next to the new design (full size is linked):</p><p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/wpzoomredesigncomparison.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16300\" title=\"WPZoom 2011 redesign comparison\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/wpzoomredesigncomparison-600x518.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"518\" /></a></p><p>This week must have some cosmic significance when it comes to site redesigns.

Both are built by core WordPress developers, both offer a way to push specific updates to the WordPress core through a simple plugin as opposed to a full WordPress update, and they do it safely without modifying any core files.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hotfix/\"><strong>Hotfix</strong></a> &#8211; &#8220;This unofficial plugin provides fixes for selected WordPress bugs, so you don&#8217;t have to wait for the next WordPress core release.&#8221;</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ui-labs/\"><strong>UI Labs</strong></a> &#8211; &#8220;UI Labs is a plugin that offers experimental WordPress admin UI features with the aim of building upon and enhancing the default WordPress User Interface.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I must admit, the two are rather intriguing. Hotfix offers immediate fixes to certain bugs that may not be addressed until the next core update, while UI Labs offers a sneak peek at some of the upcoming design improvements. I especially like the fact that, unlike core updates, these plugins don&#8217;t modify the core files and can be deactivated at any time. Both plugins offer an incredibly safe and efficient way to obtain new bug fixes and design improvements.</p>\n<p>How do you feel about these two plugins, and what do you think about the concept of pushing core updates through plugins?</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/kLCFqtQ--W4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 13:00:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"James Huff\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: GravityForms 1.5 Released  Tons Of New Stuff\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=5177\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/qO-4TRC9mWg/gravityforms-1-5-released-tons-of-new-stuff\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3541:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gravitylogo.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/gravitylogo.png\" alt=\"gravityforms logo\" title=\"gravitylogo\" width=\"108\" height=\"109\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2322\" /></a>It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve seen an upgrade notice for <a href=\"https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=54585&c=ib&aff=82985\">Gravity Forms</a> but alas, 1.5 is here. This new version incorporates a ton of new features and enhancements. Among the new features are:</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Page Forms</strong> &#8211; Using the new Page Break field you now have the ability split longer forms into multiple pages or steps. We have also integrated a visual paging status bar that can be used to show a progress bar or the steps involved in completing the form. </p>\n<p><strong>Pricing Fields </strong> &#8211; Pricing Fields allow you to create quotes and order forms. It features integrated pricing calculations and is compatible with the Gravity Forms PayPal Add-On. Pricing Fields consist of a Product Field, Option Field, Quantity Field, Shipping Field, Donation Field and Total Field. They allow you to easily turn your form into an order form and collect payments when combined with the PayPal Add-On. </p>\n<p><strong>Text Counter</strong> &#8211; A visual cue to show visitors the number of characters available for use on a text area. </p>\n<p><strong>CSS Ready Classes</strong> &#8211; Easily create multi-column layouts using built in CSS classes. These keywords are custom CSS classes you add to the CSS Class Name option under the Advanced tab for each field.</p>\n<p><strong>Default Notification</strong> &#8211; One of my favorite new additions will now automatically setup an admin notification that uses the WordPress Admin email as the Send To and includes all submitted form fields when a new form is created.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of other things added as well but you can check those out on the spiffy new <a href=\"http://www.gravityhelp.com/gravity-forms-v1-5-released/\">GravityForms Website</a>. I&#8217;ve been using Gravity Forms on WPTavern.com to handle my contact form for a few months now and I&#8217;m happy to say that it&#8217;s some of the best money I&#8217;ve spent. While I only use it for a contact form, the UI enables me to quickly and easily create a post submission form or edit my existing forms. So far, I&#8217;ve yet to see an alternate form solution that&#8217;s as elegant and easy to use as Gravity Forms.</p>\n<p>Kudos to the team on their newly designed website. One of the pain points regarding their old design was that it was difficult to locate the blog part of the site. Thankfully, they&#8217;ve fixed that by adding the blog link to the top of the new design. </p>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/review-of-gravityforms-could-creating-forms-be-any-more-kick-ass\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Review Of GravityForms &#8211; Could Creating Forms Be Any More Kick Ass?\">Review Of GravityForms &#8211; Could Creating Forms Be Any More Kick Ass?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/no-more-unlimited-support-or-upgrades-for-gravityforms-after-may-1st\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: No More Unlimited Support Or Upgrades For GravityForms After May 1st\">No More Unlimited Support Or Upgrades For GravityForms After May 1st</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/qO-4TRC9mWg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 Mar 2011 09:28:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPCandy: Beginners Guide: How to install WordPress manually\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=12979\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wpcandy/~3/oZP8fVRFab8/how-to-install-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11270:\"<p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=12979\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16309\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/howtoinstall-teaser.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"220\" /></a></p><p>There are a couple of ways to install WordPress, and you should do it in a way that works for you. Some hosts have &#8220;one-click&#8221; installs via applications that install WordPress without you getting your hands dirty. You can also install it manually with an FTP client or Shell access. We&#8217;re going to go the manual route with FTP in this tutorial for a couple of reasons:</p><ul><li>There are simply too many hosts with different variations of automated installation processes.</li><li>We want to know what&#8217;s going on, so we&#8217;re going to &#8220;get our hands dirty&#8221;, if you will. Don&#8217;t worry though, we won&#8217;t get too terribly dirty &#8212; one of the best things about WordPress is how easy it is to work with.</li></ul><p>Now hold your horses, we need to make sure you have the few tools and some information required to perform a manual install.</p><p><span id=\"more-12979\"></span></p><h3>Tools needed for a manual install</h3><ul><li><strong>FTP or <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Shell\">Shell </a>access</strong> &#8211; FTP is the simplest way to go here. File Transfer Protocol allows you to guess what&#8230; transfer files.  This is how you upload and download files to your host&#8217;s server. There are a lot of choices for FTP clients, or the  interface that connects you to the server. I personally use <a href=\"http://fireftp.mozdev.org/\">FireFTP</a> (Mozilla Firefox app), as it is lightweight, is an in-browser application, and does everything you need for WordPress purposes. Another popular, well documented, Mac / Windows / Linux capable desktop application is the <a href=\"http://filezilla-project.org/\">FileZilla client</a>.</li><li><strong>Text Editor</strong> &#8211; When working with code, you need a text editor that doesn&#8217;t alter what you input, a.k.a, Microsoft Word IS NOT a text editor. Notepad (for Windows) and TextEdit (for Mac) are the default system text editors, but they are super lightweight and don&#8217;t come with any frills. I personally love <a href=\"http://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad++</a> for Windows, because it is powerful enough and also simple enough for my needs with WordPress. I hear <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/\">TextWrangler </a>is a good alternative to Notepad++ for Mac users. There are also paid versions of TextEditors and many other free ones. View a <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Text_editor\">larger list</a> put together on WordPress.org.</li></ul><h3>Required information to perform an install</h3><ul><li><strong>FTP login info</strong> &#8211; You should have established FTP login information with your host already. You need your username and password for FTP access to the server. The address for the FTP site will be like your web address, but instead of http://domain.com, it will be ftp://domain.com. If you have WordPress installed in a subdomain of the primary domain you host with, then you will still login to the primary FTP account and perform the install in a folder within that account.</li><li><strong>cPanel (hosting control) login info</strong> &#8211; You need to make sure you know how to access your hosting control panel, or cPanel, with your host so that you can set up the database for WordPress.  It is possible that your host already set up a database for you, and you will need your database name and user information handy.</li></ul><p>Alright, we&#8217;ve got our tools, so let&#8217;s get started.</p><h2>Steps to install WordPress</h2><h3>Download the latest stable release</h3><p>WordPress is an open source software that is constantly being  improved upon by members of the community. The development goes on in  the background so that end users only get stable versions on live  installs. The most recent, most stable version is always on the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">WordPress.org download page</a>. You should always be running the most recent  release to protect your site and never be afraid of updates!</p><p>So <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">head on over</a> there and click the big blue button for the direct download of the zip file.</p><h3>Create a database and user</h3><p>You need to create your MySql database and username for the installation.  The easiest way to do this is usually through your host&#8217;s cPanel, or hosting control center. Login to your account and look for a link called MySql, Databases, or something similar.  There should be a guide similar to the pictures below that walk you through naming your database and creating a user.</p><p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-install-wordpress/attachment/createdbuser\" title=\"CreateDBUser\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/CreateDBUser-150x150.png\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"CreateDBUser\" title=\"CreateDBUser\" /></a><br /> <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-install-wordpress/attachment/createdatabase\" title=\"CreateDatabase\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/CreateDatabase-150x150.png\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"CreateDatabase\" title=\"CreateDatabase\" /></a><br /> <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-install-wordpress/attachment/installwp-2\" title=\"Beginner\'s guide to install WordPress\"><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/InstallWP1-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail\" alt=\"Beginner\'s guide to install WordPress\" title=\"Beginner\'s guide to install WordPress\" /></a></p><p>After you name your database appropriately, you&#8217;ll also need to input a database host. Typically localhost is what you use, but not always. Some popular hosts use other names, and you can <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Possible_DB_HOST_values\">view them here</a>, but certainly verify with your host the appropriate name.</p><p>When you create the user, remember to choose a good long password with upper and lowercase letters and some numbers too. Remember both the database name and user information, because we will need it for the next step.</p><h3>Edit wp-config.php</h3><p>In our WordPress download from earlier, there is a file included called wp-config-sample.php.  We need to edit that file and rename it to wp-config.php.  So open up wp-sample-config.php in your text editor, and let&#8217;s alter the following values.</p><pre>/** The name of the database for WordPress */\ndefine(\'DB_NAME\', \'database_name_here\');\n\n/** MySQL database username */\ndefine(\'DB_USER\', \'username_here\');\n\n/** MySQL database password */\ndefine(\'DB_PASSWORD\', \'password_here\');\n\n/** MySQL hostname */\ndefine(\'DB_HOST\', \'localhost\');</pre><ul><li>Replace  database_name_here with the database name you defined in the previous step, keeping the single quotes.</li><li>Replace username_here with your database username you defined in the previous step, also keeping the single quotes.</li><li>Replace password_here with your database password you defined in the previous step, also keeping the single quotes.</li><li>localhost can stay the same unless your host uses a different name as described in the previous step.</li></ul><p>Next we need to set up our secret keys. There are eight lines in a row that say &#8220;put your unique phrase here&#8221;.  These are security keys that were <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/set-up-a-secret-key-in-wordpress-25\">introduced</a> in WordPress 2.6 and enhanced in WordPress 2.7.  Note that this is extremely important, and you should not slack off from using a proper security key!</p><p>WordPress has even made this task super easy for you with this <a href=\"https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/\">secret key generator</a>. Just go to the url and copy the code and replace the existing lines in your config file. This url randomizes the keys so they are unique every time the page is visited. Yes, they are supposed to be crazy long and full of weird stuff.</p><p>Once you finish with the edits, be sure to rename or copy this file as wp-config.php. If you don&#8217;t do this WordPress won&#8217;t think you did anything at all.</p><p>If you want to read all of the nitty gritty details of editing wp-config, check out the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php\">WordPress Codex page</a> about it.</p><h3>It&#8217;s time to upload our files!</h3><p>Alright, pull up your FTP client and login. After you login, find the directory you want to load WordPress. If you want WordPress to be on the homepage of your site (which I recommend) it needs to go in the root folder. Depending on your host, the root folder may actually have its own place in your FTP connection. If you don&#8217;t put your files in the root, visitors will have to go to  http://yourdomain.com/whatever-folder-you-want to see your WordPress site.</p><p>When you upload your files, you don&#8217;t upload the entire WordPress folder, but rather open the WordPress folder and upload each file and folder into the root or subdirectory depending on where you are installing it.</p><h3>Run the install script</h3><p>Let&#8217;s visit your new WordPress site! Go to http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php. If you didn&#8217;t upload WordPress in the root folder, then you need to insert that folder name, such as http://yourdomain.com/whatever-folder-you-want/wp-admin/install.php.</p><p>Now you will be greeted with the WordPress setup page. You need to input your site title, the admin username (I recommend NOT using admin!), a strong password (you can use the same one as you used for the database if it makes it easier), and your email that will be used for notification purposes. You can also choose whether you want your site to be indexed by search engines, which if the site is not for private purposes, you want to leave that checked.</p><p>Click &#8220;Install WordPress&#8221; and you should be done! You can visit your url where you installed it to check and see how it looks. Congratulations! You&#8217;ve successfully installed WordPress and it is time to make it awesome!</p><p><em>Did you recieve an error notification? Check out the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Common_Installation_Problems\">most common errors and how to fix them</a>.</em></p><h3>Now what?</h3><p>You will now be greeted by the default WordPress theme on your homepage. If you want to get familiar with the backend, go to http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin, login, and look around. As the administrator of your new website, you&#8217;ll spend a lot of time here.</p><p>With your new website, you may find it advantageous to have a <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-install-wordpress-locally-on-a-mac\">local setup</a> as well, and we can walk you through it.

It seems pretty obvious that they intended the video to be controversial, an attempt to create virality. They knew that &#8220;something that you might believe to be entirely ridiculous&#8221; would be passed around and drive up page views. And that worked &#8212; sort of. Apparently the response was strongly negative enough that BC Gurus have taken down the original video and replaced it with a message which states:</p><blockquote cite=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/tag/wordpress/Brent Weaver, BC Gurus\"><p>The right people, called the right people, who called the right people and told us to take the video down.</p><p>We respect ALL of those people, so this video is indefinitely offline.</p><p>I am currently out of the office on vacation, but will respond to all complaints next week.</p></blockquote><p>Well, then! When you whack the hornet&#8217;s nest with a stick, sometimes you get stung. Not only did the link get passed around, but they garnered some really good responses, particularly from people at  <a href=\"https://acquia.com/\">Acquia</a>, which is  a commercial arm for Drupal, much as <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> is for WordPress. They made a <a title=\"Proprietary software vendors take aim at Open Source\" href=\"https://acquia.com/blog/proprietary-software-vendors-take-aim-open-source\">blog post</a> and response video which speaks for all three communities. Speaking for myself, I approve of this message:</p><p></p><p>It would have been really easy to respond in-kind with a video of somebody using a BC Gurus logo for target practice. But instead,  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/horncologne\">horncologne</a> (who posted the YouTube video) took the high road, and show groups of people at conferences, supporting their projects, and using them to build solutions for clients. Very classy. I hope that clients looking for web site solutions will see this. Lots and lots of clients.</p><p><span>{photo CC licensed by-nc-sa <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/neotsn/2272219134/\">Neo</a>}</span><br />><br /></a>}</span><br />}</span><br />><br /></a>}</span><br /><br /><a class=\"geolocation-link\" href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/tag/wordpress/feed\" id=\"geolocation42427\" name=\"33.991,-84.15300000000002\">Posted from Duluth, Georgia, United States.</a></p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2010/05/11/wordpress-and-drupal\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WordPress and Drupal\">WordPress and Drupal</a></li><li><a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2009/06/22/drupal-shop-gives-props-to-wordpress\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Drupal shop gives props to WordPress\">Drupal shop gives props to WordPress</a></li><li><a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/12/20/wordpress-and-jabber-sitting-in-a-tree\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WordPress and Jabber, sitting in a tree&#8230;\">WordPress and Jabber, sitting in a tree&#8230;</a></li></ol></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 23:09:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Dougal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: How To Mimic The WPTavern Commenting System\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=5171\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/aC8nQTmkuaY/how-to-mimic-the-wptavern-commenting-system\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5910:\"<p>Over the past few days, I&#8217;ve had a couple of people ask me what plugins I use to accomplish my commenting system here on WPTavern.com.

WPTurbo is an auto blogging plugin, with the built in functionality to pull in content to your site from Amazon, eBay, IMDB, Twitter, YouTube, and over a dozen others. Basically if you have content out there and want it on your site, it looks like WPTurbo is made just for that.</p><p>Dale explains in his announcement post that he has been working on WPTurbo for some time now, and is happy to have it finally released to the public:</p><blockquote><p>Things have been a bit quiet on WPLift over the last month, the reason is I have been working hard on finishing off a new premium WordPress plugin called <a href=\"http://wpturbo.com/\">WPTurbo</a>. Its actually been in development since last year  I have been working hard to get the website ready for launch and am pleased to announce its now live and ready to purchase.</p></blockquote><p>Dale&#8217;s WPTurbo plugin costs $149, and of course you can do whatever you want with it once it&#8217;s yours.</p><p><span id=\"more-16272\"></span></p><p>Auto blogging plugins are a funny sort of thing. The way an auto blogging plugin works, is it pulls in content from other sites and automatically publishes them to your site. Plenty of legitimate uses come to mind. You could quickly populate a test site, or grab your own eBay listings and include them on your site. You could keep a backup copy of your tweets on your own blog (an idea I definitely support). Of course there are also a number of ways to use a plugin like this for evil, such as publishing someone else&#8217;s hard work to your own site. Dale&#8217;s work is still noteworthy despite the evil you <em>could</em> do with it, so I&#8217;ll just channel my inner  <a title=\"Uncle Ben on Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben\">Uncle Ben</a> and say: <em>with great power comes great responsibility</em>.</p><p>Help me out here: speak up in the comments if you use an auto blogging plugin, perhaps even Dale&#8217;s new WPTurbo, in a reputable way. These plugins deserve some honest users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 17:48:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Ryan Imel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 3/24\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=9813\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/6Lva-dJknVA/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2086:\"<h3>New plugins</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/dynamic-content-widget/\"><strong>Dynamic Content Widget</strong></a> will render content (such as pages and posts), using a template in your theme.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://swiftthemes.com/swiftdynamicthumbs-plugin-to-generate-thumbnails-dynamically-when-needed/\"><strong>SwiftDynamicThumbs</strong></a> prevents WordPress from generating thumbnails registered by themes and plugins, and generates them dynamically when required.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ui-labs/\"><strong>UI Labs</strong></a> offers experimental WordPress admin UI features with the aim of building upon and enhancing the default WordPress User Interface.

The right WordPress theme can make your blog pop, and while that wont make or break your blog it might give you the inspiration to continue blogging and making a great site.</p><p>Sometimes its not easy to find the perfect WordPress theme. There are a lot of WordPress themes out there, but the perfect theme can at times seem like a needle in a haystack. To help you in your searching, weve put together the following guide to finding WordPress themes. If were missing a solid method, feel free to add your own tips in the comments.</p><p><span id=\"more-15342\"></span></p><p>The various methods well be looking at are:</p><ul><li>Browse the WordPress Theme Directory</li><li>Visit your favorite commercial theme provider or marketplace</li><li>Search for, and bookmark, collections of WordPress themes on various WordPress blogs</li><li>Use a theme finding tool: ThemeSorter, Theme Finder, other theme search engines</li></ul><h3>Browse the WordPress Theme Directory</h3><p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16257\" title=\"Free WordPress theme directory (teaser)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/freethemedirectory-teaser.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"250\" /></a></p><p>Weve all said <a title=\"Ryan Imel\'s editorial, \">our piece</a> about the state of WordPress themes in the free <em>dot org</em> directory at one point or another. While the designs of <a title=\"WordPress Theme Directory\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/\">Theme Directory</a> themes arent always top notch, there are a few gems to be found. Plus, you never know when the quality might improve.</p><p>How you browse the Theme Directory is up to you. You can browse themes straight from your WordPress Dashboard from the Appearance &gt; Themes &gt; Install screen. On that screen you can search for certain kinds of themes. If you would like to browse a bit more casually, I would recommend visiting the WordPress Theme Directory directly. Check out the most popular themes, browse by tag, or just page through those most recently added.</p><h3>Visit your favorite commercial theme provider or marketplace</h3><p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/presents/the-wordpress-theme-mascot-throw-down\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-13151 alignnone\" title=\"WordPress mascot lineup (teaser)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/wpmascotlineup.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"240\" /></a></p><p>Commercial theme shops are popular with good reason: people love quality work. By and large, the quality produced by professional theme designers and developers is top notch. So sometimes, depending on what you&#8217;re looking for, it&#8217;s best to stick to the quality and support you know and can count on. This won&#8217;t work out every time, but hey: when&#8217;s the last time you browsed through your favorite theme shop&#8217;s collection? It certainly couldn&#8217;t hurt.</p><p>Worth mentioning here are also theme marketplaces. They differ from what I call <em>shops</em> in that they offer themes from many different authors, rather than only a specific few. There aren&#8217;t as many marketplaces as there are shops: <a title=\"Theme Forest\" href=\"http://themeforest.net/\">Theme Forest</a>, <a title=\"Mojo Themes\" href=\"http://www.mojo-themes.com/\">Mojo Themes</a>, <a title=\"Wonder Themes\" href=\"http://wonderthemes.com/\">Wonder Themes</a> (when they are public), and <a title=\"Theme Garden\" href=\"http://www.themegarden.com/\">Theme Garden</a> are all marketplaces that may have what you are looking for.</p><p>On the topic of theme shops, WPCandy (and myself, actually) tend to be pretty neutral. There are plenty of folks out there doing awesome, awesome work. Which shops are your favorite, and which ones would you recommend others spend time searching through? Share with us in the comments.</p><h3>Search for, and bookmark, collections of WordPress themes</h3><p>Sometimes the easiest way to find WordPress themes is to let others do the work for you. There are a number of WordPress blogs out there (including our own, here) that take time tracking down WordPress themes for the sole purpose of collecting similar ones in a list for others. For instance, we have brought together a few collections recently:</p><ul><li><a title=\"Retro and vintage WordPress themes\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/recommends/retro-and-vintage-wordpress-themes\">Retro and vintage WordPress themes</a></li><li><a title=\"Business card WordPress themes\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/recommends/business-card-themes\">Business card WordPress themes</a></li><li><a title=\"WordPress themes and plugins for mobile-friendly sites\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/recommends/mobile-wordpress-themes-and-plugins\">WordPress themes (and plugins) that create mobile-friendly sites</a></li><li><a title=\"Comparison of WordPress theme frameworks\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/presents/wordpress-theme-framework-comparison\">Comparison of WordPress theme frameworks</a></li></ul><p>You can see other collections within our <em><a title=\"WPCandy Recommendations\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/recommends\">Best Of</a></em> section, or by heading straight to our <a title=\"WPCandy\'s series on the best WordPress themes\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/series-on/the-best-wordpress-themes\">Best WordPress Themes series</a>. Were not the only ones doing this, though. Oli Dale at <a title=\"WPLift\" href=\"http://wplift.com/\">WPLift</a> has put together some pretty awesome lists over there too, which are easily some of my favorite lists around. One thing I would not recommend is simply searching for lists of WordPress themes online. You may end up finding themes that aren&#8217;t reputable, safe, or worth your time. In this case it&#8217;s very important to use trusted sources.</p><p>Do you have your own favorite sources for WordPress theme collection posts? Be sure to share them in the comments, particularly if you have assembled your own lists!</p><h3>Use a tool to find your theme</h3><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16263\" title=\"Theme finding tools\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/themefindingtools.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"56\" /></p><p>If youre looking for a very specific type of theme, sometimes the normal searching methods wont work. In those cases using the methods listed above will take a long time. Instead, try out a specialty theme search tool.</p><p>We built <a title=\"Theme Finder, for finding WordPress themes visually\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/announces/theme-finder-find-wordpress-themes-visually\">Theme Finder</a> a few months back to solve just this problem for ourselves. Currently you can use it to search for themes by color, by layout, and by price. It currently holds over 600 high quality WordPress themes, with new ones added every month.</p><p>I would also recommend checking out <a title=\"ThemeSorter\" href=\"http://themesorter.com/\">ThemeSorter</a>, another similar theme search engine that operates a bit differently than Theme Finder. <a title=\"QualiThemes\" href=\"http://qualithemes.com/\">QualiThemes</a> is another solid resource thats useful for finding themes by searching for keywords. <a title=\"Yellow Themes\" href=\"http://yellowthemes.com/\">Yellow Themes</a> is another theme search engine worth trying out.</p><hr />Hopefully you feel a bit more equipped to find WordPress themes than you were before.

Either the fundamentals have changed since they were students or there are minor details that they never need to know before. Sometimes you just need to go back to school.</p><blockquote class=\"jump\"><p>Just as important are the subjects it doesn&#8217;t cover.</p></blockquote><p><em><a title=\"WordPress for Dummies on Amazon\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/WordPress-Dummies-3rd-Lisa-Sabin-Wilson/dp/0470592745\">WordPress For Dummies</a></em>, by Lisa Sabin-Wilson is the perfect primer for WordPress. Between the iconic yellow covers are the integral basics everyone should know but maybe didn&#8217;t learn. I have never had the need to really dig in and learn about WordPress.com, setting up a MU network or importing a site from Blogger, but it&#8217;s all in there. And I know I&#8217;m not the only one who has had a client ask a basic question that just stumped them. This is the perfect go-to resource for those situations.</p><p><span id=\"more-16210\"></span></p><p>This is also a great book to suggest to clients. It can turn a novice into a capable user pretty quickly without going into advanced topics that might result in a 3am phone call because they broke their site. Advanced users might scoff at the sections on &#8220;Uploading and using images&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Setting your profile&#8230;&#8221; but these are important basics that one might gloss over when introducing a newcomer to the world of WordPress.</p><p>Just as important are the subjects it doesn&#8217;t cover. There are no advanced chapters that will make your clients eyes haze over. It seems the author, Sabin-Wilson, intentionally kept PHP references, and any mention of editing files to a complete minimum.</p><p>No one wants to be caught buying or reading a &#8220;For Dummies&#8221; book that deals with their profession but this one might be worth the risk. Because it is a &#8220;For Dummies&#8221; book the writing is very lighthearted, instructions are listed step by step and there are heaps of screenshots and URLs. <em>WordPress For Dummies</em> holds your hand and shows you the fundamentals rather than lecturing you.</p><p>It makes you comfortable learning, even if it is something you feel you should have known already. Because of that it deserves a place in your WordPress library.</p><p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/rated/four-mints\" title=\"WPCandy rated this 4 mints\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2007/09/mints-four.jpg\" alt=\"WPCandy rated this 4 mints\" width=\"600\" height=\"80\" /></a></p><p><em>This review was written using the Kindle version of WordPress for Dummies 3rd Edition.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 05:13:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Eric Weiss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPCandy: Cory Miller, WordPress entrepreneur, interviewed on Relentless Business\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16228\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wpcandy/~3/iUn5kNobeK8/cory-miller-wordpress-entrepreneur-interviewed-on-relentless-business\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:466:\"<p></p><p>Cory Miller is the WordPress entrepreneur behind iThemes, PluginBuddy and WebDesign.com.

I&#8217;ve found that feature to be too limiting. For starters, the linking is limited to posts on your site. Secondly, you need to use the Visual editor in order to use the linking feature. There is a better way to accomplish the same feature set and more with a plugin called <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/insights/\">Insights</a> by Vladimir Prelovac. This plugin adds a meta box that you can move to the right side or below the post editor and does not require the use of the visual editor. When in use, you type in some search terms into the search box and select where to perform the search. This is where Insights shines as you can select <em>your own blog, Google Images, Google Videos, Wikipedia, Google, Google News, Google Blogs, and Google Books</em>. The search results are present in the same meta box where you can either open the result in a new tab or copy the link to put in your post. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5168\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/insightsinuse.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/insightsinuse.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"insightsinuse\" width=\"517\" height=\"270\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5168\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Search Results For Insights On WPTavern</p></div>\n<p>Sometimes I need to find a link to a site when I&#8217;m writing a post and I can do that easily by selecting the Google search where I can copy and paste the link without using a new window or leaving the post editor. Talk about convenient. So if you&#8217;re looking for more flexibility in linking to content from the past while not being required to use the visual editor, the Insights plugin should fit the bill. </p>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/review-of-beeline-im-buzzed-off\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Review Of Beeline &#8211; I&#8217;m Buzzed Off\">Review Of Beeline &#8211; I&#8217;m Buzzed Off</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/uWAy-MNUTaY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 01:15:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPCandy: Standard Theme sees redesign of landing page, adds post formats in version 2.6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16189\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wpcandy/~3/VpOaFm1yXQI/standard-theme-launches-version-2-6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1867:\"<p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=16189\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16191\" title=\"Standard Theme site redesign (teaser)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/03/standardthemeredesign-teaser.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"250\" /></a></p><p>Tom McFarlin updated the Standard Theme blog today to announce a redesigned landing page and a theme upgrade.

Since WPTavern.com is also hosted on HostGator, I decided to try and replicate the bug. Following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bradleypotter/status/50092690188148737\">his</a> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bradleypotter/status/50093083022462976\">instructions</a> I was able to replicate the error pointing towards the possibility of something on HostGator not configured just right.</p>\n<p>While testing another plugin by Trevor Fitzgerald that ties into his website <a href=\"http://www.presstags.com\">PressTags.com</a>, I noticed that the Reblog feature didn&#8217;t work. It provided the same error as the Comment Trash link bug that Brad had mentioned. The reblog feature uses the built in PressThis bookmarklet in WordPress to republish an article. After going back and forth with Trevor as I thought his plugin was the one causing the error, I decided to install a fresh copy of WordPress within a subfolder to see if I could recreate the PressThis bookmarklet error. Sure enough, even on a fresh install, I would receive a 404 error each time I tried to use it. However, the raw URL for the bookmarklet worked just fine. Thinking that it was an HTACCESS problem, I got with Peter Westwood on Skype to perform some more troubleshooting but we discovered that even with an empty HTACCESS file, the error still occurred. </p>\n<p>Trevor and I finally came to the conclusion that there was something wonky with HostGator and the way it treats URLs that had the following in it: <strong>_wp_original_http_referer</strong>. Both the move comment to trash link and the PressThis bookmarklet utilized this text and from what I can tell, adds the URL to my site twice within the link. Trevor then discovered a thread on the HostGator <a href=\"http://forums.hostgator.com/apache-upgrade-broke-feature-wordpress-t40603.html\">support forum from 2008</a> that mentions an Apache upgrade that broke someones site. More specifically, the PressThis bookmarklet.</p>\n<p>It looked as though <strong>mod_security</strong> had something to do with the breakage and in order for it to work again, the URL had to be whitelisted by HostGator. After I created a support ticket with HostGator explaining the situation and linking to the thread, they were able to tell me that some of the things I had been doing were definitely triggering some mod_security rules. They whitelisted those items which ended up fixing my problem not only with the PressThis Bookmarklet but with the Move Comment To Trash link as well. </p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re running on HostGator and the same thing is happening to you, create a support ticket and request that you be whitelisted for those mod_security rules. One of the questions I had received after publishing the answer to this support question is whether the whitelist for mod_security opens up the site to any security vulnerabilities. I have no idea. But if you do, please share those within the comments.</p>\n\n\n<p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/matt-talks-ning-foundation-and-pressthis\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Matt Talks Ning, Foundation, And PressThis\">Matt Talks Ning, Foundation, And PressThis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/hostgator-now-has-quickinstall\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: HostGator Now Has QuickInstall\">HostGator Now Has QuickInstall</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/NtWW6VVAKsA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Mar 2011 22:37:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Joseph: iPad Optimized WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"http://josephscott.org/?p=3888\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/03/ipad-optimized-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:275:\"<p>Nick <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/ipad-onswipe-theme/\">announced new iPad display optimizations</a> for WordPress.com.

Staffed by professional WordPress support staff, developers, advanced users, theme designers, and even some of the core contributors and project leaders, the booth will be open from 11am-6pm each day to answer questions and help people with any WordPress problems they might have. If you are at South by Southwest this year, consider stopping by to say hello and pick up a WordPress button or sticker. We&#8217;ll also have a limited supply of the special WordPress/Texas shirts that we&#8217;ll be giving away at the booth, so if you&#8217;re at SxSW between now and Thursday, stop by.  Hope to see you there!</p>\n<p><em>Location: The WordPress booth will be in trade show stand numbers 829, 831, 928, and 930 (it&#8217;s an endcap booth that combines those four spaces).

The planning is just beginning, so save the date on your calendar and keep an eye on the <a title=\"WordCamp SF 2011\" href=\"http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp SF 2011</a> site (and/or follow the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/WordCampSF\">@wordcampsf</a> twitter account) for updates as details become available.</p>\n<p>*For people who attended WordCamp SF last year who thought the annual event this year would be called WordCon, with WordCamp SF becoming a more locally-oriented event, you can read <a title=\"What\'s in a Name?

After careful evaluation of the 3.1 features in RC2, we recognized the need to make some adjustments. There are some significant differences from previous versions of 3.1, so <strong>please</strong> review the changes if you have been developing against a beta or RC version.</p>\n<p>The biggest change is the removal of AJAX list tables, which had been an effort to move all of our list-style screens to full AJAX for pagination, searches, and column sorts, and to consolidate the list-style screens into a single API that plugins could leverage. Unfortunately, with more testing came realizations that there were too many major bugs and usability issues with how the functionality was implemented, so we&#8217;ve spent the last week rolling back the most important portions of the feature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>For users:</strong> AJAX has been entirely disabled for the list tables. We hope to bring this back again, in a form that is properly and fully implemented, in a future release. Column sorting remains, but everything else has returned to its 3.0 state.</li>\n<li><strong>For developers:</strong> The entire list table API is now marked <em>private</em>. If you attempt to leverage new components of the API, you are pretty much guaranteeing that your plugins will break in a future release, so please don&#8217;t do that. <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':-)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' />  We hope to enable all the fun new goodies for public use in a future release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the only way we could prevent any regressions in functionality and usability from WordPress 3.0 to 3.1. That&#8217;s right, users and plugin authors can still do everything you used to be able to do (and a little bit more).</p>\n<p>Because of the code churn between RC2 and RC3, <strong>this release candidate needs a lot of testing</strong>. Every list screen needs testing. In particular, the comment moderation screen needs testing, especially with keyboard shortcuts (if you didn&#8217;t know about those, now&#8217;s your chance to try them out).</p>\n<p>Other fixes in RC3 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly display the author dropdown in Quick Edit</li>\n<li>Various important fixes to numerous taxonomy query variables</li>\n<li>Fixes to the theme deletion process</li>\n<li>Fixes to pages used for posts</li>\n<li>IIS and Multisite: Avoid resetting web.config on permalink save</li>\n<li>Properly validate post formats and their rewrite rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m assembling a group of friends in Washington, D.C., this weekend to test WordPress 3.1 and provide feedback. We&#8217;d love to see this idea catch on among friends at coffee shops around the world.

Because these factors vary, we have several levels of contributors to the core WordPress application, ranging from full-time lead developers to casual one-patch contributors.</p>\n<p>I loved it when that Intel commercial in 2009 gave Ajay Bhatt, co-inventor of the USB, some recognition as a rock star of geekland (though I hated it that it wasn&#8217;t actually Ajay Bhatt, but an actor &#8212; way to kill the message, Intel).<sup>1</sup> In WordPress-land, most people know who Matt Mullenweg is, but most of the other leaders and contributors are much less visible. Moving forward, I&#8217;m going to be posting profiles here of some of our more dedicated contributors.</p>\n<p>Why now? We&#8217;re coming up on the second annual WordPress core leadership meetup in January 2011, and we&#8217;re thinking we&#8217;ll hold a video town hall at some point during our time together. Between now and then the profiles I post will be of the core developers who will be at the meetup. After that, I&#8217;ll be branching out and posting about other contributors, including developers, designers, forum moderators, etc.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll post here in January when we have dates/times set for the video town hall. In the meantime, you can submit questions for us to answer then in the forum thread <a title=\"Suggestions thread\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/what-should-2011-hold-for-wordpress?\">What Should 2011 Hold for WordPress?</a></p>\n<p>To get a sense of how all these people fit together and how decisions are made, you can check out the presentation I did at WordCamp Portland in October on <a title=\"How WordPress Decisions Get Made video\" href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2010/09/18/jane-wells-how-wordpress-decisions-get-made/\">How WordPress Decisions Get Made</a><span style=\"font-size: 11.6667px\">.</span></p>\n<p><sup>1 &#8211; And how lame is it that Conan O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s interview with the real Ajay Bhatt is no longer available on the The Tonight Show&#8217;s website, and everyone&#8217;s embedded videos are blank?

If you find problems, let your plugin/theme authors know so they can figure out the cause.</li>\n<li>If any known issues crop up, you&#8217;ll be able to <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5\">find them here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are testing the release candidate and think you&#8217;ve found a bug, there are a few ways to let us know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post it to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a></li>\n<li>Report it to the <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers\">wp-testers mailing list</a></li>\n<li>Join the development IRC channel and tell us live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev</li>\n<li>File a bug ticket on the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Trac</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.1, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (you&#8217;ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;).

Kundan Meena jewelry pieces have encrusted gemstones on one side and smooth decorated colored surfaces on the other. This kind of jewelry making involves setting a precious stone such as a diamond, sapphire or ruby on its mount using a gold foil.\n\nMost of the intricate Kundan Meena jewelry is made by skilled artisans, which adds to the value of the pieces. The designs are simple yet aesthetic, consisting of simple geometric patterns to more elaborate embellishments. One standout feature of most Kundan Meena jewelry pieces is that they are colorful and eye-catching. Regardless of whether a precious or semi-precious gem is used, the finished product looks beautiful and sophisticated.\n\n<strong>How Kundan Meena jewelry is made</strong>\n\nThe process of Kundan Meena jewelry making first involves preparing the gold foil. The gold is made soft and malleable after passing it through a rolling machine that churns out flat sheets of 22 carat. The resulting gold sheet is hammered and beaten to get the required thickness.\n\nAfter the soft gold sheet is ready, the artisans carve the desired gold design with their hands or using tweezers. The resulting pattern forms the outer walls of the finished jewelry piece. The number of designs that have to be carved out depend on the type and size of the piece under making. After the gold designs have been fashioned out of the gold foil, they are bonded or soldered together to form the final shape of the jewelry piece. The soldering is done traditionally by puffing fire out of pipes onto the gold pieces and combining them into one solid piece, such as an earring or a necklace.\n\nThe black residue on the jewelry piece after the soldering process is cleaned using mild chemicals and then dried. After this, the piece is handed over to the gem setter. In gem setting, first the lac is heated and poured into the creek, which is supposed to hold the gem. Meanwhile the gem or stone that has to be encrusted is prepared. A gold or silver foil is fixed to the back of the gem to make it gleam. The gemstones are now placed into the creeks or holders.\n\nIn the final step, the bits of 24 carat gold foils or kundan are set into the sides of the gemstones till they grip on tightly. In the Meenakari process, which is intricate and laborious, enamel colors are added to the jewelry piece through an engraving and fusing technique.\n\nEvery Indian bride dreams of wearing a one-of-a-kind Kundan Meena jewelry set these days. After exquisite Kundan Meena pieces worn by Aishwarya Rai in the Bollywood epic Jodha Akbar caught the publics fancy, many jewelry showrooms in India have seen a rise in sales of Kundan Meena jewelry. Traditional handcrafted jewelry such as Kundan Meena has been cherished for centuries in India and is now finding popularity world over.\n\nNote:This is an article  by the nethaat team and no part of it can be copied/reproduced without permission","Making of Kundan Meena Jewelry","This writeup tells in details about one of the very popular and traditional jewelry art in India","publish","open","open","","making-of-kundan-meena-jewelry","","","2011-02-01 15:00:41","2011-02-01 15:00:41","","0","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=52","0","post","","1");

Kundan Meena jewelry pieces have encrusted gemstones on one side and smooth decorated colored surfaces on the other. This kind of jewelry making involves setting a precious stone such as a diamond, sapphire or ruby on its mount using a gold foil.\n\nMost of the intricate Kundan Meena jewelry is made by skilled artisans, which adds to the value of the pieces. The designs are simple yet aesthetic, consisting of simple geometric patterns to more elaborate embellishments. One standout feature of most Kundan Meena jewelry pieces is that they are colorful and eye-catching. Regardless of whether a precious or semi-precious gem is used, the finished product looks beautiful and sophisticated.\n\n <strong>How Kundan Meena jewelry is made</strong>\n\nThe process of Kundan Meena jewelry making first involves preparing the gold foil. The gold is made soft and malleable after passing it through a rolling machine that churns out flat sheets of 22 carat. The resulting gold sheet is hammered and beaten to get the required thickness.\n\nAfter the soft gold sheet is ready, the artisans carve the desired gold design with their hands or using tweezers. The resulting pattern forms the outer walls of the finished jewelry piece. The number of designs that have to be carved out depend on the type and size of the piece under making. After the gold designs have been fashioned out of the gold foil, they are bonded or soldered together to form the final shape of the jewelry piece. The soldering is done traditionally by puffing fire out of pipes onto the gold pieces and combining them into one solid piece, such as an earring or a necklace.\n\nThe black residue on the jewelry piece after the soldering process is cleaned using mild chemicals and then dried. After this, the piece is handed over to the gem setter. In gem setting, first the lac is heated and poured into the creek, which is supposed to hold the gem. Meanwhile the gem or stone that has to be encrusted is prepared. A gold or silver foil is fixed to the back of the gem to make it gleam. The gemstones are now placed into the creeks or holders.\n\n In the final step, the bits of 24 carat gold foils or kundan are set into the sides of the gemstones till they grip on tightly. In the Meenakari process, which is intricate and laborious, enamel colors are added to the jewelry piece through an engraving and fusing technique.\n\n \n\nEvery Indian bride dreams of wearing a one-of-a-kind Kundan Meena jewelry set these days. After exquisite Kundan Meena pieces worn by Aishwarya Rai in the Bollywood epic Jodha Akbar caught the publics fancy, many jewelry showrooms in India have seen a rise in sales of Kundan Meena jewelry.

They are a bit boring and old fashioned and are rarely used. We are reluctant to throw them to avoid being wasteful, but in the end they are just old shoes piling up in our house.\n\n \n\nDo you have a pair of old shoes?\n\nDo you want to glam up your shoes?\n\nDo you want to give them a new birth?\n\n \n\nIf you just said \'yes\', then here we go-\n\nWith the following tips and tricks you can convert your old, granny shoes into glam shoes instantly. Or you can make previously unsuitable shoes match your new outfit. Or you can make one pair of shoes seem like several. From beautiful to fashionable, elaborating your shoes can be easy with the following simple ways.\n\nThe first step of your artsy mission is to acquire the ingredients. You just need some clip findings, ribbons, beads, lace, faux pearls, silk or paper flowers, clip on shoe accessories, rhinestones, cabochons and other tiny trinkets and don\'t forget contact cement and bobby pins to secure these things on your shoes.\n\nAfter you gather all bits and bytes you can, make your designs. Keep your designs simple. Just don\'t paste all stuff on one pair of shoes. Try to make different design with different color combinations for different pairs. However, you can have the same design for both the shoes of the same pair.\n\nThere are many ways to design simple tidbits. You can make a tailored bow (actually a pair would be better) from ribbons or you can give a romantic touch by affixing lace, a strand of faux pearls or delicate beaded trim around the opening of sandals. You can use studded rhinestones to attach the lace to add glitzy touch. You can also give a spring look to your sandals by affixing silk or paper flowers or butterflies and sea shells and more.\n\nEvery design doesnt have to be elegant. You can decorate as casually as you want. You can also use fabric paint designs on your shoes. Design making needs a lot of practice and once you are on you\'ll become better and better with time. Once you\'ve had a little practice you\'ll have the most extensive shoe wardrobe of anyone you know.\n\nWith this level of creativity your shoes can transform into customized, engaging compliments to your personality. You can also turn a pair of cheap pumps or flats into refined accessories for you ensembles, so you should learn to decorate your plain shoes to get the great look you desire. The next time you\'re considering a new pair of shoes thinks instead of redecorating a pair you already own and impress your friends with your creativity.","Getting creative with your old shoes","","publish","open","open","","getting-creative-with-your-old-shoes","","","2011-02-20 14:41:13","2011-02-20 14:41:13","","0","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=103","0","post","","0");

The gold is made soft and malleable after passing it through a rolling machine that churns out flat sheets of 22 carat. The resulting gold sheet is hammered and beaten to get the required thickness.\n\nAfter the soft gold sheet is ready, the artisans carve the desired gold design with their hands or using tweezers. The resulting pattern forms the outer walls of the finished jewelry piece. The number of designs that have to be carved out depend on the type and size of the piece under making. After the gold designs have been fashioned out of the gold foil, they are bonded or soldered together to form the final shape of the jewelry piece. The soldering is done traditionally by puffing fire out of pipes onto the gold pieces and combining them into one solid piece, such as an earring or a necklace.\n\nThe black residue on the jewelry piece after the soldering process is cleaned using mild chemicals and then dried. After this, the piece is handed over to the gem setter. In gem setting, first the lac is heated and poured into the creek, which is supposed to hold the gem. Meanwhile the gem or stone that has to be encrusted is prepared. A gold or silver foil is fixed to the back of the gem to make it gleam. The gemstones are now placed into the creeks or holders.\n\nIn the final step, the bits of 24 carat gold foils or kundan are set into the sides of the gemstones till they grip on tightly. In the Meenakari process, which is intricate and laborious, enamel colors are added to the jewelry piece through an engraving and fusing technique.\n\nEvery Indian bride dreams of wearing a one-of-a-kind Kundan Meena jewelry set these days. After exquisite Kundan Meena pieces worn by Aishwarya Rai in the Bollywood epic Jodha Akbar caught the publics fancy, many jewelry showrooms in India have seen a rise in sales of Kundan Meena jewelry. Traditional handcrafted jewelry such as Kundan Meena has been cherished for centuries in India and is now finding popularity world over.","Making of Kundan Meena Jewelry","This writeup tells in details about one of the very popular and traditional jewelry art in India","inherit","open","open","","52-revision-16","","","2011-01-28 13:40:37","2011-01-28 13:40:37","","52","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=70","0","revision","","0");

Kundan Meena jewelry pieces have encrusted gemstones on one side and smooth decorated colored surfaces on the other. This kind of jewelry making involves setting a precious stone such as a diamond, sapphire or ruby on its mount using a gold foil.\n\nMost of the intricate Kundan Meena jewelry is made by skilled artisans, which adds to the value of the pieces. The designs are simple yet aesthetic, consisting of simple geometric patterns to more elaborate embellishments. One standout feature of most Kundan Meena jewelry pieces is that they are colorful and eye-catching. Regardless of whether a precious or semi-precious gem is used, the finished product looks beautiful and sophisticated.\n\n<strong>How Kundan Meena jewelry is made</strong>\n\nThe process of Kundan Meena jewelry making first involves preparing the gold foil. The gold is made soft and malleable after passing it through a rolling machine that churns out flat sheets of 22 carat. The resulting gold sheet is hammered and beaten to get the required thickness.\n\nAfter the soft gold sheet is ready, the artisans carve the desired gold design with their hands or using tweezers. The resulting pattern forms the outer walls of the finished jewelry piece. The number of designs that have to be carved out depend on the type and size of the piece under making. After the gold designs have been fashioned out of the gold foil, they are bonded or soldered together to form the final shape of the jewelry piece. The soldering is done traditionally by puffing fire out of pipes onto the gold pieces and combining them into one solid piece, such as an earring or a necklace.\n\nThe black residue on the jewelry piece after the soldering process is cleaned using mild chemicals and then dried. After this, the piece is handed over to the gem setter. In gem setting, first the lac is heated and poured into the creek, which is supposed to hold the gem. Meanwhile the gem or stone that has to be encrusted is prepared. A gold or silver foil is fixed to the back of the gem to make it gleam. The gemstones are now placed into the creeks or holders.\n\nIn the final step, the bits of 24 carat gold foils or kundan are set into the sides of the gemstones till they grip on tightly. In the Meenakari process, which is intricate and laborious, enamel colors are added to the jewelry piece through an engraving and fusing technique.\n\nEvery Indian bride dreams of wearing a one-of-a-kind Kundan Meena jewelry set these days. After exquisite Kundan Meena pieces worn by Aishwarya Rai in the Bollywood epic Jodha Akbar caught the publics fancy, many jewelry showrooms in India have seen a rise in sales of Kundan Meena jewelry. Traditional handcrafted jewelry such as Kundan Meena has been cherished for centuries in India and is now finding popularity world over.","Making of Kundan Meena Jewelry","This writeup tells in details about one of the very popular and traditional jewelry art in India","inherit","open","open","","52-revision-17","","","2011-01-28 13:40:58","2011-01-28 13:40:58","","52","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=84","0","revision","","0");

In the Meenakari process, which is intricate and laborious, enamel colors are added to the jewelry piece through an engraving and fusing technique.\n\nEvery Indian bride dreams of wearing a one-of-a-kind Kundan Meena jewelry set these days. After exquisite Kundan Meena pieces worn by Aishwarya Rai in the Bollywood epic Jodha Akbar caught the publics fancy, many jewelry showrooms in India have seen a rise in sales of Kundan Meena jewelry. Traditional handcrafted jewelry such as Kundan Meena has been cherished for centuries in India and is now finding popularity world over.\n\nNote:This is an article  by the nethaat.com and no part of it can be copied/reproduced without permission","Making of Kundan Meena Jewelry","This writeup tells in details about one of the very popular and traditional jewelry art in India","inherit","open","open","","52-revision-18","","","2011-01-31 19:49:24","2011-01-31 19:49:24","","52","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=87","0","revision","","0");

You just need some clip findings, ribbons, beads, lace, faux pearls, silk or paper flowers, clip on shoe accessories, rhinestones, cabochons and other tiny trinkets and don\'t forget contact cement and bobby pins to secure these things on your shoes.\n\nAfter you gather all bits and bytes you can, make your designs. Keep your designs simple. Just don\'t paste all stuff on one pair of shoes. Try to make different design with different color combinations for different pairs. However, you can have the same design for both the shoes of the same pair.\n\nThere are many ways to design simple tidbits. You can make a tailored bow (actually a pair would be better) from ribbons or you can give a romantic touch by affixing lace, a strand of faux pearls or delicate beaded trim around the opening of sandals. You can use studded rhinestones to attach the lace to add glitzy touch. You can also give a spring look to your sandals by affixing silk or paper flowers or butterflies and sea shells and more.\n\nEvery design doesnt have to be elegant. You can decorate as casually as you want. You can also use fabric paint designs on your shoes. Design making needs a lot of practice and once you are on you\'ll become better and better with time. Once you\'ve had a little practice you\'ll have the most extensive shoe wardrobe of anyone you know.\n\nWith this level of creativity your shoes can transform into customized, engaging compliments to your personality. You can also turn a pair of cheap pumps or flats into refined accessories for you ensembles, so you should learn to decorate your plain shoes to get the great look you desire. The next time you\'re considering a new pair of shoes thinks instead of redecorating a pair you already own and impress your friends with your creativity.","Getting creative with your old shoes","","inherit","open","open","","103-revision-5","","","2011-02-20 06:06:51","2011-02-20 06:06:51","","103","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=110","0","revision","","0");

Ever since man learned to carve wood, he has been using this versatile material to create innumerable things including utensils, weapons, furniture, shelter and decorative items. Although the other uses have slowly been taken over by other stronger or more durable material, decorative items in wood are still just as popular as ever.\n\n<strong>The appeal of wooden crafts</strong>\n\nThe evolution of wood crafting techniques and tools has made it much easier to create stunning handicrafts using this base material today. However, there are many master craftsmen in India who still favour the use of traditional tools such as chisels, saws and hammers to create truly unique wooden decorative pieces.\n\nOne of the main reasons why wooden handicrafts continue to hold their strong position in the decorative items market is that they are resilient and easy to maintain. These items can be transported even across countries without a single scratch marring the finish. A simple brushing or cleaning with a cloth is all that is required to keep your wooden artefact in mint condition. Even the age old wooden items that hung in your grandfathers home can be restored to beauty with a quick coat of varnish.\n\n<strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_139\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Intricate Wooden design \"]<a href=\"http://www.nethaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/4.2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-139\" title=\"4.2\" src=\"http://www.nethaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/4.2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Intricate Wooden design \" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n</strong>\n\n<strong>Wood lends to many options</strong>\n\nWood is one material that lends itself to any kind of decor. Although many people associate wood with ethnic interiors, there are many offices where wooden figurines or embossed wall pieces lend grace to the reception area. Wooden lattice work screens can be found at many elite hotels and restaurants as separators. Antiques made of wood are ageless decorative pieces that fit in just as perfectly into a cosy home as in a formal conference hall. A drab, colourless room can be transformed into an elegant area by using the right kind of wood decorative pieces.\n\nThere is a huge range of options to choose from when you want a wooden decorative piece to brighten up your home or office. An intricately carved wooden frame can be used to showcase a simple painting. A wood carved representation of an object or a well known figure can lend a personal touch to a room or shift focus of beholders to a specific theme. For example, a shipping business may have an elaborate carved ship in its reception area.\n\nWood has been the favoured material for hundreds of artisans because of its versatility and it will continue to grace the homes and offices of many across the world for ages to come. Be it a gift item or a decorative piece that you want in your home, a wooden artefact is the perfect addition to any room.","Woodwork- The Best Decorative Pieces for Your Home","","publish","open","open","","woodwork-the-best-decorative-pieces-for-your-home","","","2011-03-07 16:44:18","2011-03-07 16:44:18","","0","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=138","0","post","","0");

Wooden lattice work screens can be found at many elite hotels and restaurants as separators. Antiques made of wood are ageless decorative pieces that fit in just as perfectly into a cosy home as in a formal conference hall. A drab, colourless room can be transformed into an elegant area by using the right kind of wood decorative pieces.\n\nThere is a huge range of options to choose from when you want a wooden decorative piece to brighten up your home or office. An intricately carved wooden frame can be used to showcase a simple painting. A wood carved representation of an object or a well known figure can lend a personal touch to a room or shift focus of beholders to a specific theme. For example, a shipping business may have an elaborate carved ship in its reception area.\n\nWood has been the favoured material for hundreds of artisans because of its versatility and it will continue to grace the homes and offices of many across the world for ages to come. Be it a gift item or a decorative piece that you want in your home, a wooden artefact is the perfect addition to any room.","Woodwork- The Best Decorative Pieces for Your Home","","inherit","open","open","","138-revision","","","2011-03-07 16:39:06","2011-03-07 16:39:06","","138","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=141","0","revision","","0");

Later, the technique also found its way to India,Europe and other places across the world. Wooden blocks were the most commonly used implements to make these designs although some craftsmen also used porcelain or metal blocks. Block printing is a highly labour intensive task and requires meticulous care from the craftsman. But once completed, the fabric gains an elegance and splendour that is rarely matched by another design form.</div>\n \n\nIn India, hand block printing from Rajasthan has been very popular and mostly named by the prints and motif styles  as sanganeri  and bagru prints named after the towns in Rajasthan where they originated. The technique of hand block is finding popularity on various forms of cloths like Cotton, silks, georgette etc and is being used in various innovative ways in fashion circuit.\n\nThe Sanganeri hand block printed textile products from Rajasthan have been awarded Geographical Indication (GI) Status that will protect it from being duplicated anywhere else. This status allows some 300 producers of the sanganer region to take legal action against the infringement of the name of their product. The screen printed textiles in Rajasthan which are sold in the name of sanganeri will now be illegal\n\nAlthough hand block printing was very common in olden days before machines made designing so simple and fast; in recent past, not many of these fabric prints were to be found in the fashion circles. However, this printing form seems to be making a spectacular comeback if the recent Fashion Weeks are any measure of current trends.\n\n<strong>Hand block printing in the fashion world</strong>\n\nWell known designer Ritu Kumar gets the credit for revitalising hand block printing and for bringing back interest to this age old fabric art form. Kumar started small with a vision to bring Indias best to the world stage. She had a couple of hand block printers in a small fabric design studio in Calcutta when she first made her entry into the world of fashion design about 30 years back. Today, both Ritu Kumar and hand block printing have carved a niche for themselves in Indian and international fashion.\n\nThe recent display of hand block printed saris and suits by Chaitali Biplab at the Blenders Price Bangalore Fashion Week showed that there are many others who are willing to hold the flame of Indian fabric hand block printing aloft. The back to basics trend that is sweeping through the fashion world is, no doubt, contributing to the impetus that traditional fabric design forms are now beginning to enjoy.\n\n<strong>The appeal of these fabrics</strong>\n\nSubtle shades of colour, traditional materials like crisp cottons, stunning silks or even jute embellished with intricate block printed designs make a stunning formal or casual ensemble.

Art, any form of it, takes patience, practice and perseverance. Drawing is no exception. If you want to draw better then you should draw everyday. Mastering any art takes sweat, so practice. Procrastination is your biggest enemy at this stage and it will try to hold you as prisoner.

Draw when you are sitting idle. Draw instead of watching television, its more productive.\n\nAs soon as you train yourself to draw anytime- anywhere, move on to next step- draw from life. Draw the things you see instead of drawing from their photographs. If you live in Paris, go to Eiffel tower and draw it instead of drawing pyramids. Just get out of your house and observe nature as it is. Go to some park or coffee shop or any other place where you expect to find people. Initially draw live sketches of inanimate objects and then move on to draw the people as they stand in line to pay or disorganized on a platform while boarding trains.\n\nAfter you have practiced rough sketches, move to permanent. Painting with inks and other permanent media burns down your option to erase when things go wrong but it is an important step if you want to improve your sketching skills. You can learn to drive a car in your neighborhood with less traffic around, but if you are planning to go to work with it- you must practice it in traffic (though only after learning to drive). This is what we are trying to do here, giving you the confidence to draw without having to erase. At first, you will be shy and draw carefully measured lines since you have just lost your ability to erase. But very soon you will lose your internal fear of drawing wrong lines. You will start focusing more on your subject and less on perfecting the lines, just as you focus on street and don\'t search for breaks once you have learned to drive.\n\nAfter your strokes grow bolder you can focus on some refining skills to make your drawings even better. You should try to draw with your non-drawing hand in order to enhance your focus. You should study anatomy to improve your skill level. The knowledge of person\'s build, skeletal structure and joints will help you while drawing people as well as animals. You should look at your subjects as geometrical shapes- square, rectangle, circle etc. this will give you the power to draw fast. Also draw same objects in different poses or angles to enhance your perception of depth.\n\nGiving finishing touch to your skills practice on works by masters. Redrawing works of Picasso, Michelangelo and daVinci will help you more and you will understand the bigger challenges.

You should look at your subjects as geometrical shapes- square, rectangle, circle etc. this will give you the power to draw fast. Also draw same objects in different poses or angles to enhance your perception of depth.\n\n Giving finishing touch to your skills practice on works by masters. Redrawing works of Picasso, Michelangelo and daVinci will help you more and you will understand the bigger challenges. Happy drawing.","Ways to improve your drawing skills","","inherit","open","open","","158-revision-2","","","2011-04-03 03:35:32","2011-04-03 03:35:32","","158","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=162","0","revision","","0");
