Based in the textile city Jaipur (Sanagner), Shilpi has been a successful craft based business using traditional techniques of hand block printing and embroideries. Founded by the traditional textile printer from Sanganer ,Brij Udaiwal, the company focuses on providing employment to 85 odd units dealing in hand-block printing, hand embroidery and stitching and which are located in Jaipur, Sanganer, Bagru and near by places. The company treats every craft person as the original creator of the design and the process because he is the one who knows his job well and has been doing it since ages and thus can create things which are truly his own creations. Thus every craft person in Shilpi is a Shilpkar. Shilpi Handicraft has a team of designers who regularly strive at providing latest trends and know how to the craft persons in order to inculcate the innovation amongst them. Also they emphasize on constantly experimenting and innovating, especially with modern colors and patterns to see how they could be applied to the craft. Mr. Brij Udaiwal is a National Award Winner (year1991) and over the years he has been actively working for the up-liftment of craftsmen by running various educational and vocational training centers. He is also energetically involved in the developments which are taking place regarding the future of hand-block printing in Sanganer. As part of its policy, Shipi has adopted various units which depend directly or indirectly for work. These units work in coordination with different subsidiaries of Shilpi Handicrafts ( Shilpi ,Prakhya, Weave N Prints, Pugmarks and Shilpi Sansthan) which are dealing in fabrics, handicrafts, garments and accessories, gifts etc. The company is currently venturing into retailing and service sector and thus holds its promise of promoting crafts and craftsperson","1","durga","","","","","","3","1","2010-11-21 21:16:28","0","0","","","0","","","","1","","","","0","0");

One gets the sense of being caught in a time warp as camel drawn carts, laden with logs of shesham and bales of fabric, sashay their way down chaotic dusty streets, enabling with every step the metamorphosis of their cargo into gorgeously hued hand block printed textiles.    The block-printed cottons of Jaipur have been renowned for their exquisite pattern, and coloring for at least two hundred and fifty years. Traditional prints favored greatly by the Mughal Emperors and their imperial courts, featured delicate floral sprays, spaced evenly on a white, pastel blue or yellow ground of fine cotton. While designing our collection of home furnishings it has been our endeavor to fuse traditional flavor with a good dose of modern aesthetic sensibility.    The tradition of hand block printing has continued to exist on a parallel universe, stubbornly resistant to industrialization, and is to this day practiced without the aid of mechanization or computerization. It is this defiant indifference to mechanization that gives block printing the aura of a pure craft form and makes block printed textiles so esteemed. Traditionally these textiles played an integral part of village life. However, with the introduction of mill prints and easy to maintain wash and wear synthetics, these textiles are gradually losing their appeal to the village consumer. It is only a growing appreciation of this craft in urban and export markets that is keeping this ebbing craft alive.","2","sanganer","welcome","Paypal","By courier","N/A","Thanks for visiting our store.","3","1","2011-04-04 05:45:26","0","0","","2011-01-20 13:28:28","0","","","","1","","","","0","0");

It&#8217;s a challenging role, but you&#8217;ll have the support of a talented and experienced team that can really deliver for you.</p>\n<p>You should have the following core qualities and experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to &#8220;get things&#8221; quickly. This isn&#8217;t a place for the complacent. We enjoy the chance to play with new technology and are always taking on new challenges.</li>\n<li>The desire to organize and manage and a willingness to juggle. Each project has its own unique path with challenges that arise throughout. The project manager has key responsibility throughout the project&#8217;s entire life cycle.</li>\n<li>A general understanding of how web technologies work and interact. We build things from the ground up, we customize, we integrate. You&#8217;ll learn something new on each project, but there has to be a solid base to start from.</li>\n<li>A willingness to make decisions, even if they end up being mistakes. Mistakes happen, it&#8217;s how we learn. The key is to make them with good intentions and to always make new ones.</li>\n<li>Excellent communication skills (written and verbal) and an understanding of nuance.</li>\n<li>High standards and a willingness to stand up and say so if you believe standards aren&#8217;t being met.</li>\n<li>You do <em>not</em> need to have prior project management experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> This position is available immediately in our Denver office, and we are only considering local candidates<sup><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn1303977863426n\" id=\"fn1303977863426\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> at this time.</p>\n<p>All of this sound good?

His second book, <a href=\"http://www.1000awesomethings.com/book2\">The Book of (Even More) Awesome</a>, is out today.<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><strong>How did you get the idea to create a blog about 1000 Awesome things? Does your blog help you become a happier person?</strong></p>\n<p>NEIL: Well, I was in a pretty rough place when I started the blog. My wife and I were growing further and further apart and my best friend was battling a major depression. When I flipped open the newspaper or turned on the TV it was about melting ice caps, terrible hurricanes, and the collapsing economy.</p>\n<p>I started 1000 Awesome Things to try and find a way to cheer myself up. I wanted to find a place where bakery air, snow days, and popping bubble wrap were the most important things in the world.</p>\n<p>Over the next couple of years my personal life got worse. <a href=\"http://1000awesomethings.com/2010/02/17/567-getting-to-the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel/\">My wife told me she didnt love me anymore</a>. <a href=\"http://1000awesomethings.com/2009/02/16/829-smiling-and-thinking-of-good-friends-who-are-gone/\">My best Chris took his own life</a>. And in most ways Im still the same guy  working the same office job in the suburbs, eating the same frozen burritos for dinner, and still needing to go to the gym more.</p>\n<p>But in many ways Ive become happier because I see awesome things everywhere. I hit a string of green lights on my way home from work and think awesome! I flip to the cold side of my pillow in the middle of the night and think awesome! And I think these little daily highs add up to longer term happiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you choose WordPress and what have you liked most about using it as a publishing service?</strong></p>\n<p>NEIL: Ha ha, I think I literally Googled how to start a blog and clicked on the first link!</p>\n<p>But my experience with WordPress since that first day has been absolutely incredible. The <a href=\"http://en.forums.wordpress.com/\">forums</a> helped me figure out every issue Ive got (and Ive had issues!) and whenever I <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/\">email support</a> they reply right away.</p>\n<p>On a bigger note though, I really do think WordPress is changing the world by <strong>helping people from all places and spaces communicate their message to the world</strong>. Nothing could be more powerful than that.</p>\n<p><strong><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1416\" title=\"Pasricha Photo 1 - credit Gala Darling\" src=\"http://wordpresspublishers.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/pasricha-photo-1-credit-gala-darling.jpg?w=212&h=180\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"180\" />How did you get a book deal, and when is your second book coming out?</strong></p>\n<p>NEIL: Well let me tell you a crazy story! When I started writing <a href=\"http://1000awesomethings.com\">1000 Awesome Things</a> back in June, 2008 nobody read it except for my mom. Although, the traffic did double when she forwarded it to my dad.</p>\n<p>Then I got excited when I emailed it to friends and tens of people started coming each day. Then it become hundreds, then thousands, then millions and then I got a phone call! And the voice at the other end of the line said You just won the best blog in the world award!</p>\n<p>Obviously, I thought this was some sort of spammy joke. But I somehow ended up winning the Webby Award for Best Blog in 2009 and got flown to New York to walk a red carpet with Martha Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, and Sarah Silverman.</p>\n<p>When I came home there were ten literary agents waiting for me in my inbox asking if I wanted to put together a book. It was a total <em>Julie and Julia </em> moment and it kind of hit me how powerful our little blogging community really is.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.1000awesomethings.com/book2\"><em>The Book of (Even More) Awesome</em> comes out today</a>, April 28th!<strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anything else you&#8217;d like to share regarding WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p>NEIL: Yes! To everyone out there with a WordPress blog: You are awesome! We may never meet, we may never talk, but I completely love, respect, and admire how much passion and energy goes into all of our sites.</p>\n<p>Maybe nobody realizes how long we slave over posts, how excited we are when we check our Stats pages, or how fun it is to get a comment from someone weve never met. Ive been feeling these buzzes for two years and theyve never got old to me. I am so grateful, so proud, and so flattered to be part of this amazing community.</p>\n<p>Lets keep on blogging forever  and lets always stay strong and stay AWESOME!</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for the chat and for those that check it out I really hope you like <a href=\"http://www.1000awesomethings.com/book2\"><strong><em>The Book of (Even More) Awesome</em>.

The following list includes what I consider to be the most important Google tools, some others nearly every web developer uses, and hopefully even some that you don&#8217;t know about yet.</p><p>In this post we&#8217;ll be looking into 18 Google services and applications, including:</p><ul><li><span>Google Analytics</span></li><li><span>Goo.gl url shortener</span></li><li><span>Google Chrome/Developer Tools</span></li><li><span>Google Website Optimizer</span></li><li><span>Google Docs</span></li><li><span>Google Custom Search</span></li><li><span>Google Maps</span></li><li><span>Google Reader, and</span></li><li><span>Google Adsense/Adwords</span></li></ul><p><span id=\"more-13022\"></span></p><h3>Google Analytics</h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-17989\" title=\"Google Analytics WordPress \" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/GoogleAnalyticsGraph.png\" alt=\"Google Analytics WordPress \" width=\"600\" height=\"132\" /></p><p>Nearly all website owners use Google Analytics. There are so many resources and cool things you can track with this invaluable tool. Track referrers, clicks, advertising, and a gillion other things. Track one website or a thousand. Target specific content, see where your visitors live, how long they&#8217;re on your site, and much, much more. Enough of me, check out these awesome tutorials for using Google Analytics.</p><ul><li><span><a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-install-google-analytics-in-wordpress/\">Setup and basics</a> by WPBeginner</span></li><li><span><a href=\"http://blog.kissmetrics.com/50-resources-for-getting-the-most-out-of-google-analytics/\">More tutorials</a> than you ever wanted by KISSmetrics </span></li><li><span>Definitive <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/\">WordPress Analytics</a> plugin by Joost de Valk </span></li></ul><h3>Goo.gl url shortener</h3><p>Google couldn&#8217;t miss out on the shortlinks action, so they came up with their own provider, <a href=\"http://goo.gl\">goo.gl</a>. Google <a href=\"http://googlesocialweb.blogspot.com/2010/09/google-url-shortener-gets-website.html\">claims it&#8217;s not</a> just another url shortener. Do you use it as your default shortener? If not, <a href=\"http://goo.gl/0m7v4\">this article</a> by Kovshenin can help you get started with integrating it into WordPress, and you can also check out a <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=goo.gl\">couple of plugins</a> that have popped up around it.</p><h3>Google Chrome / Developer Tools</h3><p>Google Chrome is now responsible for more than <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2379105,00.asp\">10% of all browser usage</a>, more than Safari and Opera combined. It has a great reputation for being extremely fast and very stable &#8212; like most Google stuff, I&#8217;d say. One of the only complaints I tend to see from web developers is that it doesn&#8217;t have all the fun extensions that Firefox has. But it is getting close.</p><p>Chrome comes with a built in pack of Developer Tools, that some say is better than Firefox&#8217;s Firebug. Chrome also has Firebug lite and a lot of other awesome extensions that are similar to Firefox&#8217;s offerings. I made the switch to using Chrome as my default browser a few months ago, and I now I think I have as much power in the Chrome Developer Tools and extensions as I had in Firefox.</p><h3>Google Website Optimizer</h3><p></p><p>Split-testing can be extremely valuable for your landing and sales pages. We even heard from <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/interviewed/david-perel\">Obox</a> how a small change in their sales page made a drastic difference in theme sales. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics/siteopt/\">Google Website Optimizer</a> helps you create experiments to see what works best for your site.</p><p>Website Optimizer is pretty advanced stuff (in my opinion at least). If you are looking for a simpler option, you may want to look at the <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/free-ab-testing-wordpress-plugin-by-max-foundry\">MaxA/B</a> free WordPress plugin that lets you compare WordPress pages in a matter of minutes. But if you want to dive into all the details of multivariate split-testing, Google&#8217;s product is a great place to start.</p><h3>Google Libraries API</h3><p>Google keeps minified libraries of a lot of code frameworks. Using simple scripts, you can use these libraries with WordPress. Even if WordPress already loads a framework, like it does with jQuery, you can still register and use the Google version. There is some argument about how good of an idea this is, but many claim it&#8217;s faster than using the WordPress packaged version. It&#8217;s obviously a good idea for any library not already bundled in WordPress.</p><p>The Google Libraries API currently supports Chrome Frame, Dojo, Ext Core, jQuery, jQuery UI, MooTools, Prototype, script.aculo.us, SWFObject, Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI), and WebFont Loader. Learn more with the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/intl/en/apis/libraries/devguide.html\">developer guide</a>.</p><p>The easiest way to get started with integrating Google hosted libraries and WordPress is to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/use-google-libraries/\">use a plugin</a>, but you can also go the manual route, which can be fun. The basic idea would be the following (credit: <a href=\"http://www.w3-edge.com/weblog/2011/02/optimize-social-media-button-performance/\">Frederick Townes</a>):</p><pre>\n<div>&lt;?php</div>\n<div>wp_deregister_script(\'jquery\');</div>\n<div>wp_register_script(\'jquery\', \'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js\');</div>\n<div>wp_enqueue_script(\'query\');</div>\n<div>?&gt;</div>\n</pre><p>This method is best to use in a custom extension or plugin, if anywhere. New themes will likely <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/2011/03/01/topic-for-discussion-jquery/\">not allow</a> registering jQuery this way.</p><h3>Google Font Directory</h3><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-14200\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/Google-Font-Directory.gif\" alt=\"Google Font Directory\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" />The <a href=\"http://code.google.com/webfonts\">Google font directory</a> is one of the most exciting new things to using non-standard fonts in our websites. The font directory does all the dirty work of implementing the CSS @font-face technique, including all of the <a href=\"http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/google-font-api-guide/\">best practices</a> for making it cross-browser compatible.</p><p>The directory is entirely free to access, takes one line of code to implement, and you can use the fonts just like any other in your stylesheets. They started with just a few available fonts, but now there are dozens and more and more show up all the time.</p><p>This is my single favorite Google resource right now. You can implement the font directory multiple ways. For personal and client projects you could use <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-google-fonts/\">a plugin</a> or just use a simple @import command at the top of your css file and then just use the font name in your stylesheet. It could look like this:</p><pre>\n<div>@import url(\'http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans\');</div>\n<div>#body { font: normal normal normal 14px/20px \'Droid Sans\', Arial, sans-serif; }</div>\n</pre><h3>Google Checkout</h3><p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14204\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/googlecheckout.png\" alt=\"google checkout\" width=\"220\" height=\"111\" />Google checkout is a cart solution similar to PayPal. It may not be the most familiar checkout option to WordPress users, but it is at least a viable solution to work alongside PayPal and other third party options.</p><p>The biggest positive of Checkout is the deep integration with Google Adwords and Google Product Search. One drawback is that Google Checkout doesn&#8217;t play well outside of the United States and United Kingdom, and by not play well I mean <a href=\"http://checkout.google.com/support/sell/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=134420\">isn&#8217;t available</a>.</p><p>There are a <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/lbak-google-checkout/\">couple</a> of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-google-checkout-shopping-cart/\">plugins</a> worth considering that can help you integrate this shopping cart application into your WordPress site.</p><h3>Google Chart Tools</h3><p>I&#8217;ll be honest. I just discovered Google&#8217;s <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/charttools/\">chart tools</a>. With these, you can pretty easily use Google Docs to <a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/easy-graphs-with-google-chart-tools/\">create interactive charts</a> for use on your website. There is a lot of power and potential behind these tools, and the sky is pretty much the limit with what you can do. Assuming the sky is limited to charts, of course.</p><h3>Google Docs</h3><p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-14412\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/googleDocs.png\" alt=\"Google Docs\" width=\"151\" height=\"267\" />Google Docs is a great way to bring office tasks to the web. It is easy to share documents, spreadsheets, presentations and even forms. One of my favorite features is the ability to live-edit a document with a public or private group.</p><p>Ryan did this with a spreadsheet to line up interviews for WordCamp Phoenix. He simply invited people to sign up for a time on the shared Google spreadsheet. Awesome, right?</p><p>You can also <a href=\"http://wn.com/How_to_embed_a_Google_Doc_into_Wordpress_Blog\">embed Google Docs</a> right into your WordPress posts and pages. All in all, it&#8217;s a nice, online-friendly alternative to Microsoft Office.</p><h3>Google Custom Search</h3><p>Google&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.google.com/cse/\">custom search</a> feature lets you create just that, a custom search engine, and implement it on your own website. You can set up all sorts of features, such as making it just search your site, or a select number of sites, exclude certain results, and many other things. You can also connect your adsense account to the ads that display at the top of search results in the free version. The paid version includes the ability to remove the ads, and starts at $100 per year.</p><p>You get all of the power of Google in your own search engine. It&#8217;s really a nice alternative to WordPress search, which to be honest, could use a facelift.</p><h3>Google Maps</h3><p>There are a <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/google-maps\">slew of Google Maps related plugins</a>, but <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress/\">MapPress</a> will allow you to do a basic, but thorough, integration of Google Maps into your WordPress site. Google Maps is an extremely powerful tool that almost everyone uses in everyday life, and thanks to other people&#8217;s efforts, we can also use Google Maps to assist us in our development projects.</p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14195\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/WPCandyPoweredMap.jpg\" alt=\"WPCandy Powered Map\" width=\"552\" height=\"299\" /></p><h3>YouTube</h3><p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-14194 alignright\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/youtube-logo-2.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube logo\" width=\"150\" height=\"106\" />YouTube is good for a lot more than watching funny cats and bros getting tazed (although I do love those). It is a great platform to upload and share all types of videos. And because YouTube bears the burden of the heavy lifting, we can spend less of our own bandwidth serving up the video itself.</p><p>WordPress has made it easier than ever to <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds\">embed</a> YouTube videos, so that now all you have to do is enter the url of the video on its own line and WordPress takes care of the rest. Of course, if you want more control, you may like <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tubepress/\">TubePress</a> or <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vipers-video-quicktags/\">Viper&#8217;s Video Quicktags</a>.</p><p>You can also take advantage of using your YouTube channel to expand your social profile and get visitors to your site.</p><h3>Gmail</h3><p>You may think I&#8217;m strange for including Gmail in a post about Google products and WordPress, but I&#8217;d venture to say a majority of WordPress developers use Gmail as their base account.</p><p>It&#8217;s really easy to have all of your emails consolidated to a single Gmail account. You can have your main account, forward emails from different domains to that account, and then use a ton of tools to organize and manage your emails. I have about half a dozen email accounts that all forward to my single Gmail account.</p><h3>Google Reader</h3><p><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-14229\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/googleReaderlogo-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"google Reader logo\" width=\"105\" height=\"105\" />Google Reader is really one of the only free web-based RSS feed tools available. It&#8217;s a pretty decent system, and it&#8217;s always nice to keep all the sites you like in one place. But, I personally recommend you still come and visit the real world every now and then <img src=\"http://wpcandy.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> .</p><p>In WordPress, keep in mind that you can change your RSS settings to either show the full content or just excerpts. Personally, I get annoyed when I can only view the excerpts, and I actually tend to visit the real site even less than when the author shows me the full content in my Reader. I know right, the opposite of the intended effect. Something to think about for those of you that only allow excerpts in feed readers!</p><p>You may also be interested in <a href=\"http://thingelstad.com/using-google-reader-send-to-with-wordpress/\">this post</a> by Jamie Thinglestad that shows how to easily add your WordPress site as a &#8220;send to&#8221; link in Google Reader so you can quickly and easily blog about posts in your feed.</p><h3>Google Adsense / Adwords</h3><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14523\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/Google-Keyword-Search.png\" alt=\"Google Keyword Search\" width=\"585\" height=\"242\" /></p><p>If you are going to use ads and don&#8217;t have a high-traffic site, Google Adsense is one of the simplest ways to do it. There are fifty bagillion tutorials online as to how to best target ads to fit your content, so check out some of those. You can also see some of the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/google-adsense\">plugins in WordPress</a> designed to make it easier for you to implement Adsense with WordPress.</p><p>Certainly one of the coolest things about Adwords, whether you use them for buying ads or not, is the <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal\">keyword search tool.</a> It&#8217;s simple to see how often specific words and phrases are searched for, both globally and locally.</p><h3>Feedburner</h3><p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-17992\" title=\"feedburner in wordpress\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/feedburner.png\" alt=\"feedburner in wordpress\" width=\"100\" height=\"110\" />Feedburner is a great tool that can redirect your WordPress feeds through their system so you can track your subscribers in many different ways. It also helps you customize your feeds and has tools for things like managing email subscriptions.</p><p>Tentblogger has done an outstanding job explaining in detail <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/tentblogger.com/feedburner\">how to set up Feedburner</a>. Even if you&#8217;ve set up Feedburner half a dozen times, it&#8217;s worth a read.</p><h3>Google Project Hosting</h3><p>Want to maintain a project online?<a href=\"http://code.google.com/projecthosting/\"> Google Project Hosting</a> could be your answer. Similar to the idea of Github, it allows you to host projects (up to 2 GB) for free, and uses <a title=\"How to install and get started with SVN (Subversion) on Windows\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-install-and-get-started-with-subversion-on-windows\">subversion</a>, issue tracking, project wikis, and the ability to star projects and developers.</p><p>I noticed quite a few <a href=\"http://code.google.com/hosting/search?q=WordPress&btn=Search+projects\">WordPress</a> projects tagged, such as Carrington, Thematic, and NextGen Gallery.</p><h3>Google Summer of Code</h3><p>While not really an extension or tool, Google has a very cool program for students called the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/intl/en/soc/\">Google Summer of Code</a>. WordPress has participated since 2007, and a lot of great developments have come from it. You can check out all of the awesome WordPress stuff from the 2010 GSoC and learn how to apply <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2011\">on the codex</a>.</p><p>You can also <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/google-announces-2011-summer-of-code-wordpress-student-projects\">view the participants</a> for the upcoming GSoC 2011.</p><h3>Wrapping it up</h3><p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that there are a plethora of tools that Google has that can assist us in our WordPress projects. Which of these do you use? Or maybe I should ask which ones don&#8217;t you use? Also, let me know of any I missed, which I&#8217;m sure there are many.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed the list, and be sure to bookmark this post to refer back to it for your future projects.</p><div class=\"tentblogger-rss-footer\"><p>You just finished reading <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=13022\">Beginner\'s Guide: How to utilize Google resources in WordPress</a> on <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com\" title=\"WPCandy WordPress community news\">WPCandy</a>.

But what <em>could be</em> news to some of you is the recent launch of the <a title=\"yolink Search for WordPress plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yolink-search/\">yolink Search for WordPress plugin</a>, that hopes to improve the WordPress search experience by integrating their cloud-based search engine.</p><p>yolink itself is search technology from <a title=\"TigerLogic\" href=\"http://tigerlogic.com/\">TigerLogic</a> that can be used in other applications via their API. yolink is a paid service, and using it for commercial purposes or for indexing more than 50 pages of content might require you take a look at their <a title=\"yolink\" href=\"http://www.yolink.com/yolink/api/pricing.jsp\">pricing structure</a>. If WPCandy wanted to use their search API, for instance, we would need to pay $100/month.</p><p>The new yolink Search for WordPress plugin has been developed and released in partnership with <a href=\"http://wpengine.com/\">WPEngine</a> and is now available in its 1.0 version. Along with indexing content and providing improved search results, yolink will optionally add social sharing options to search content, as shown in their demo video just after the jump.</p><p><span id=\"more-17951\"></span></p><p>The best way to see what yolink does without trying it out is watching their demo video:</p><p></p><p>The plugin can be downloaded <a title=\"yolink Search plugin on the WordPress directory\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yolink-search/\">from the WordPress.org plugin directory</a>, and an API key snagged <a title=\"yolink API key\" href=\"http://www.yolink.com/yolink/developers/\">from the yolink website</a>.

It requires no signup or API keyjust install it and go.</p><p>Within the builder map pointers are very flexible, with the icons, titles, and descriptions all fully customizable. Lines and shapes be also be drawn on maps, with color and size settings customizable as well.</p><p>The plugin was released earlier this year, but is still in its early stages. Project Lead Chip Diffendaffer said they are &#8220;aiming to create a quick and easy-to-use mapping plugin for creating elegant custom maps without worrying about setting up API keys or writing JavaScript.&#8221; You can download the plugin <a title=\"MapQuest Map Builder on the WordPress.org plugin directory\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mapquest-map-builder/\">from the WordPress plugin directory</a>, and read more about it on <a title=\"MapQuest Builder plugin for WordPress\" href=\"http://tools.mapquest.com/map-builder-for-wordpress/\">MapQuest&#8217;s site</a>.</p><p>Diffendaffer said they are interested in the community&#8217;s thoughts, as well as any feature requests anyone here might have.

By powering WPCandy, members of our community can directly make the content we produce possible, and receive linked credit for doing so. This system is one of the things that brings in a lot of questions and interest from folks in our community. People ask how we do it, why we do it, and how they can emulate it. In this post I hope to answer those questions.</p><p>In this post I&#8217;ll go over:</p><ul><li><span>the philosophy behind our system,</span></li><li><span>tools and code you&#8217;ll need to do what we do,</span></li><li><span>the marketing/design side of things, and</span></li><li><span>what regular upkeep and maintenance looks like.</span></li></ul><p>I hope it answers the questions you have about our system, but if it doesn&#8217;t just toss a question or two into the comments below. Let&#8217;s get to it.</p><p><span id=\"more-17551\"></span></p><h3>Our philosophy is powered by ideals</h3><p>There are a couple of very simple techniques we use to pull off the Powered By system, but for the most part its an ideology. The best way to implement your own version of this is to first understand <em>how</em> it works, and more importantly <em>why</em> it works the way it does.</p><blockquote class=\"jump\"><p>While the Powered By system isnt designed to send traffic to supporters sites, it is designed to add to supporters reputations.</p></blockquote><p>The key is that our Powered By links dont jump directly to the supporters site or Twitter account or whatever. It actually points to a dedicated thank you page that gives a brief rundown of the supporter, any posts about them on WPCandy, and a list of the posts they have personally powered on the site. From there the person viewing the page may choose to visit the supporters site, or they may not. By making these off-site links one step removed from WPCandys content itself, anyone can learn more about who powers WPCandy without being taken away to another site they dont know about.</p><p>In this way, the Powered By system is quite different from an advertising or paid links system. No one who powers WPCandy does so strictly for backlinks and traffic. Lets face it, if they sent WPCandy money for that purpose alone it wouldnt be very wise. <em>Any</em> links to a supporters site is one step removed from any primary content page on WPCandy. No, the primary reasons that folks tend to power WPCandy are:</p><ol><li>They appreciate the site, and want to support us and our ad-free model.</li><li>They want to support the greater WordPress community, and raise their visibility within it.</li></ol><p>While the Powered By system isnt designed to send traffic to supporters sites, it is designed to add to supporters reputations. Anyone who powers the site sees credit on posts, in thank you posts, and on podcasts. In fact, just about every time we create a new form of content on the site, we find a way to incorporate thanking those who power us. They are our VIP, our Hall of Fame.</p><p>Understanding why this system is great, as well as having an audience that is receptive to it, is key to implementing something like it. Were lucky <a title=\"WPCandy Powered By system announcement\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/announces/the-wpcandy-powered-by-pla\">it has been embraced</a>, so far, at WPCandy.</p><h3>Our donation model is powered by tools</h3><p>Our system is technically pretty low-fi. We use:</p><ul><li>PayPal to manage the payments and subscriptions.</li><li>A custom taxonomy to assign content credits.</li></ul><p>And thats pretty much it.</p><p>We created PayPal buttons for our main powering page, using the option within PayPal to grab the direct email link. Then we dropped those in our pages.</p><p>The custom taxonomy is a bit more fun. In our case, we credit those who power WPCandy in posts, which you can see below each post:</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17881\" title=\"Powered By implementation example\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/04/poweredbyexample.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"69\" /></p><p>The snippet below is what we use to create our custom taxonomy, complete with our sentence URL <code>wpcandy.com/thanks/whomever</code> in place:</p><pre>\nfunction poweredby_init() {\n  register_taxonomy(\n    \'poweredby\',\n    \'post\',\n    array(\n      \'label\' => __(\'Powered by\'),\n      \'sort\' => true,\n      \'hierarchical\' => true,\n      \'args\' => array(\'orderby\' => \'term_order\'),\n      \'rewrite\' => array(\'slug\' => \'thanks\'),\n    )\n  );\n}\nadd_action( \'init\', \'poweredby_init\' );\n</pre><p>We add that to a plugin file, of course, so we can update our theme in the future without breaking any functionality like that.</p><p>Now, there is plenty more Id like to do to improve the current system. I would like to revisit our payment flow and merge the various options together into one form using Gravity Forms latest PayPal add-on. At this point though, until I make those improvements, this simple format does the job.</p><h3>Have fun with imagery</h3><p><img src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/wpcandy-supporters.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"WPCandy is powered by the community\" width=\"600\" height=\"139\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-11752\" /></p><p>Personally, I think the key with any system like this (read: a donation based system) is the way you package and promote it. Instead of simply adding a default PayPal donate button, void of personality, we created what I like to think is a branded, creative way to accomplish the same thing.</p><blockquote class=\"jump\"><p>The point? Have fun with it. If you want others to have a good time on your site you need to have fun first.</p></blockquote><p>The branding, in our case, involved a few things. First I created images to associate with each power level, and had some fun doing it. A post is represented by a single mint (or $10), a day is a bucket (of paint, it seems), a week is a wheelbarrow, and a month is a truckload, presumably of mints. Theres also the monthly option, which powers the WPCandy mint factory $5 at a time.</p><p>The point? Have fun with it. If you want others to have a good time on your site you need to have fun first.</p><p>We also implemented a status bar in the sidebar that shows how much of WPCandys content is powered for the current month.</p><p><img src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/01/wpcandystatus70.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"wpcandystatus70\" width=\"289\" height=\"30\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12377\" /></p><p>Ive received a lot of compliments on the status bar, as well as questions as to how it works. I wish I had a complicated, highly technical answer for how it works. The reality is pretty straightforward: we use images like <code>status10.png</code>, <code>status20.png</code>, and so forth, and update the sidebar widget as needed. Its not quite impressive, but it gets the job done.</p><h3>Powered best when regularly maintained</h3><p>By accepting far more individual, personal payments than we would on a traditional advertising system, we do interact with more people. Since its a community donation program, we feel its important to stay connected with those who donate on a slightly personal level. For everyone who donates, we try to:</p><ul><li>Email a thank you note directly to them.</li><li>Thank them in weekly posts on the site (been slacking in this regard lately).</li><li>Get to know them, follow them, and talk with them as often as we can.</li></ul><p>In a sense, we treat those who support the site this way as VIP members of our little community here.</p><p>Aside from that, the system pretty much runs itself. We try and mention it whenever it makes sense, but otherwise folks tend to know where to go if they want to share the love.</p><h3>What do you think? Could this system work on your site?</h3><p>I&#8217;m curious what other site owners and blog authors think about the system we&#8217;re using here. Do you think this could have legs, particularly when compared to more traditional advertising or affiliate programs?</p><p>Feel free to leave any further questions in the comments, I&#8217;ll do my best to answer them.</p><div class=\"tentblogger-rss-footer\"><p>You just finished reading <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=17551\">How to create your own Powered By system like ours</a> on <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com\" title=\"WPCandy WordPress community news\">WPCandy</a>.

Their event site is pretty straightforward right now, with very basic callouts for <a title=\"Callout for WordCamp Montreal speakers\" href=\"https://spreadsheets0.google.com/viewform?hl=en&hl=en&formkey=dDNlczVmWXNwZnVNdmlQbDZyUHRLcEE6MQ#gid=0\">speakers</a> and <a title=\"Callout for WordCamp Montreal sponsors\" href=\"https://spreadsheets0.google.com/viewform?hl=en&hl=en&formkey=dDNWMFc2Y2tCOVZsdV8xb05zSm9VU3c6MQ#gid=0\">sponsors</a>. Early bird tickets are just $30 right now, but will jump up to $40 before long.</p><p>This will make the <a title=\"WordCamp: Developers in Vancouver\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/wordcamp-developers-2011-ramping-up-for-may-5-in-vancouver\">second Canadian WordCamp</a> to take place yet this year.</p><p>Montreal also looks like yet another Canadian WordCamp that WPCandy won&#8217;t be able to make it to. This is unfortunate particularly because, according to the kind folks at Vanilla Forums that we met at WordCamp Miami, both WordPress and WPCandy are much loved in Montreal. Don&#8217;t worry, <em>non-US world</em>: we&#8217;ll be there as soon as we can be.</p><p>So make us jealous: who will be attending WordCamp Montreal this year, and just how awesome will it be?</p><div class=\"tentblogger-rss-footer\"><p>You just finished reading <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=17858\">WordCamp Montreal is on the lookout for speakers, sponsors, and early birds</a> on <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com\" title=\"WPCandy WordPress community news\">WPCandy</a>.

And if you <a href=\"http://twitter.com/dougal\">follow me on Twitter</a>, you might have seen me hint about it in tweets and screen shots. Now, you&#8217;re looking at it. Well, technically, you&#8217;re looking at a child theme (named <strong>dougalizr</strong>) with extra bits specific to my site, but still. This is my first attempt to create a theme completely from scratch.</p><p>In the past, I&#8217;ve generally started with an existing theme, then just created a child theme to do subtle alterations specific to my site. But I got tired of wrestling with doing things the way that somebody else envisioned it, or having to work around extra layers of &#8220;framework&#8221; functionality in order to change something simple. I wanted my own theme that I would know inside and out. And let me tell you, I now have a new respect for theme authors. Building a theme is a <em>lot</em> of work, because there are a zillion little pieces and details to account for. If you are a developer, and you&#8217;ve never built a WordPress theme from scratch before, I highly recommend it as an exercise.</p><p>Let me start by saying that this new theme is not revolutionary. It&#8217;s not a &#8220;theme framework&#8221;. I haven&#8217;t put in any customizable options (yet, I might in the future). It&#8217;s not a &#8220;portfolio&#8221;, &#8220;news&#8221;, or &#8220;magazine&#8221; theme. It&#8217;s just a plain blogging theme. And at the time of this writing, it&#8217;s still not even complete (see the To Do section, below). But it has some features that I think are interesting and useful, and I finally got it far enough along that it was at the <a title=\"Eating your own dogfood\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food\">dogfood</a> stage. So I&#8217;m launching it here to help expose the warts that still remain, and force me to deal with them.</p><h3>Features</h3><ul><li>All 10 <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats\">post formats</a> accounted for.</li><li>You can have different format templates for archives views.</li><li>When using the link post format, the first link in the post becomes the post link. This will be used as the link for the post title, instead of the regular post permalink.</li><li>Allows setting post format when posting via <acronym title=\"eXtensible Markup Language\"><span class=\"caps\">XML</span></acronym>-<acronym title=\"Remote Procedure Call\"><span class=\"caps\">RPC</span></acronym> (such as from the WordPress apps for iPhone or BlackBerry). Just start your post with :aside:, :link:, etc. Example: <em>:aside: Its always fun until somebody loses an eye. But then its more fun, because you get to play with the eyeball.</em></li><li>If a mobile post starts out with just an image before any text (as when you post an image from WordPress for iOS), it will automatically set the post format to image.</li><li>Any mobile post that contains a <span class=\"shortcode\">gallery</span> shortcode automatically gets the &#8216;gallery&#8217; post format.</li><li>&#8216;Chat&#8217; formatted posts can automatically bold speakers names, if you use a pattern like this (name, colon, text):<pre>Costello: Whos on first?\nAbbott: Thats right.\nCostello: What?\nAbbott: Second base.</pre></li><li>Featured image support. Currently the <acronym title=\"HyperText Markup Language\"><span class=\"caps\">HTML</span></acronym> for this is hardcoded, but I plan to allow this to be overridden.</li><li>Custom excerpt support. If a post has a custom excerpt, it will be displayed on the front page instead of the full post.</li><li>The basic layout holds together all the way down into older versions of Internet Explorer.</li><li>Basic iPhone layout adaptability (still needs some adjustments).</li></ul><p>I&#8217;m pretty excited about the post format support for mobile blogging. I got tired of waiting for the <a title=\"WordPress admin for your Apple iOS device\" href=\"http://ios.wordpress.org/\">WordPress for iOS</a> app to support post formats, so I just made a way to go ahead and do it now. I think that being able to easily post images, statuses, and asides from my iPhone will encourage me to post more to my blog, whereas before I might have put much of that on <a title=\"Dougal on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/dougal\">Twitter</a>. I still love Twitter, but I also love owning, controlling, and centralizing my content.</p><h3>To Do</h3><p>There is still a lot left to do: The orange that you currently see is temporary. I want to add some nice typography. The sidebar and footer are still ugly as sin and need styling. I need to put the hAtom microformat classes in. It still needs mobile-specific styles. There are still areas that need better HTML5 semantics. I still need to create several standard templates, such as search, page, and 404.</p><h3>Credit Where Credit Is Due</h3><p>When I say I built this theme &#8220;from scratch&#8221;, that doesn&#8217;t mean that every byte of <acronym title=\"HyperText Markup Language\"><span class=\"caps\">HTML</span></acronym>, <acronym title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\"><span class=\"caps\">CSS</span></acronym>, <acronym title=\"Php Hypertext Processor\"><span class=\"caps\">PHP</span></acronym>, and JavaScript sprung forth fully formed from my mind to my keyboard, as Athena from the forehead of Zeus. Far from it &#8212; I stand on the shoulders of giants, borrowing liberally from the work of others. Some of what you see here was inspired by:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://html5boilerplate.com/\">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and <a href=\"http://initializr.com/\">Initializr</a></li><li>Matthew James Taylors <a href=\"http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/perfect-2-column-right-menu.htm\">Perfect Right-Menu 2-Column Liquid Layout</a></li><li>The <a href=\"http://2010dev.wordpress.com/\">TwentyTen theme</a></li><li>Nicolas Gallagher&#8217;s <a href=\"http://nicolasgallagher.com/css-drop-shadows-without-images/demo/\"><acronym title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\"><span class=\"caps\">CSS</span></acronym> Drop Shadow</a> demo</li><li>Chris Coyer&#8217;s <a href=\"http://css-tricks.com/simple-jquery-dropdowns/\">Simple jQuery Dropdown</a> menus</li><li>Design Festival&#8217;s <a href=\"http://designfestival.com/typography-of-quotations-citations/\">Typography of Quotations &amp; Citations</a></li><li>&#8230;and probably many others that I can&#8217;t think of right now&#8230;</li></ul><p>I want to spend a few days working out some of the kinks here, but then I plan to make the source available. I&#8217;ve put it up on GitHub  (<a href=\"https://github.com/dougalcampbell/Formattd\">Formattd on GitHub</a>) for now, to give anyone interested a chance to offer feedback and patches. Once it&#8217;s cleaned up enough, I&#8217;ll submit it for inclusion in the official WordPress.org theme repository.</p><p>With that said &#8212; feedback welcome!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Related posts:<ol><li><a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2005/03/09/theme-preview-plugin\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: Theme Preview Plugin\">Theme Preview Plugin</a></li><li><a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2007/10/16/new-theme\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: New theme, same as the old theme\">New theme, same as the old theme</a></li><li><a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2009/07/02/wordpress-theme-licensing\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WordPress theme licensing\">WordPress theme licensing</a></li></ol></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 25 Apr 2011 11:00:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Dougal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPCandy: The next WordPress Melbourne meetup will be a Hack Night\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=17714\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/wpcandy/~3/Z55kJE1ygkc/the-next-wordpress-melbourne-meetup-will-be-a-hack-night\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2049:\"<p><a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=17714\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17715\" title=\"WordPress Melbourne words (teaser)\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/04/melbournewords-teaser.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"195\" /></a></p><p>Organizer Anthony Cole and the folks who attend the <a title=\"WordPress Melbourne meetup\" href=\"http://wpmelbourne.wordpress.com\">WordPress Melbourne</a> meetup will be holding a WordPress Hack Night at their May meeting. The focus will be on trading WordPress development questions and tips, and working on WordPress together. Cole described his hopes for Hack Night <a title=\"WordPress Melbourne meetup blog\" href=\"http://wpmelbourne.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/may-wordpress-hack-night/\">on the WordPress Melbourne meetup blog</a>:</p><blockquote><p>My personal goal is to actually contribute a patch to core by the end of the night and get at least two or three others having done the same. Well also be able to test WordPress 3.2 with your plugins and themes and debug any issues anyone whos testing it is having.</p><p>The unique selling point of the WordPress hack night is the idea that you come to learn and share. You dont need to sit in on the presentations  well most likely pour those into the board room with a more intimate setting. If youve got a WordPress dev question, chances are someone can answer it.</p></blockquote><p>Melbourne&#8217;s May event won&#8217;t be the first-ever WordPress hacking session at a meetup, of course.

Think <a href=\"http://www.retailmenot.com/\">RetailMeNot</a>, but for WordPress only.</p><p>Gliebe shared his thoughts on the launch of CouponWP in the launch post:</p><blockquote><p>The idea for CouponWP was born out of a coupons/deals section on our other website, ThemeSorter. Over there, we focus on premium WordPress themes. We thought itd be great to take that idea a step further and track coupons for WordPress plugins and hosting too. Surprisingly, our research did not turn up a site like CouponWP already in existence (at least not one that was up-to-date with <em>real</em>codes). And so here it is.</p></blockquote><p>CouponWP launched during the same span of time that <a title=\"WPBeginner\'s coupon site launch\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/wpbeginner-coupons-could-save-you-money\">WPBeginner&#8217;s coupon section</a> did. It looks like we can expect more WordPress discount sites like this in the future. Have you ever used a discount on a WordPress theme, plugin, or service? Perhaps more importantly, have you ever held off on purchasing something until a solid discount was available?</p><div class=\"tentblogger-rss-footer\"><p>You just finished reading <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/?p=17602\">CouponWP launches to save everyone a few bucks on WordPress products</a> on <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com\" title=\"WPCandy WordPress community news\">WPCandy</a>.

After preparing business plans, presentations, and learning from mentors, we are better prepared for the future and know what we really offer to the market, where we want to take this business and how we are going to get there.</p></blockquote><p>Event Espresso is a WordPress event registration and management plugin. We&#8217;ve interviewed its founder Seth Shoultes in the past, and they&#8217;re of course <a title=\"WPCandy thanks Event Espresso\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/thanks/event-espresso\">friends of WPCandy</a>.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t the only WordPress plugin-based business we&#8217;ve seen taking off lately. Gravity Forms has an install base of over 100,000 websites now, and OnSwipe (<a title=\"PadPressed mimics FlipBoard as a WordPress plugin\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/padpressed-makes-site-flipboard-like-on-ipads\">previously PadPressed</a>) has <a title=\"OnSwipe raises one million in funding\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/padpressed-becomes-onswipe-raises-one-million-in-funding\">raised one million in funding</a> and <a title=\"OnSwipe partners with Automattic on WordPress.com\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/onswipe-partners-with-automattic-ipad\">partnered with Automattic on WordPress.com</a>.</p><p>So what do you think?

href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-find-wordpress-themes-quickly-and-easily\">find WordPress themes</a>. Some prefer to make their own themes, some use only free themes, and still othersperhaps yourselfthat purchase WordPress themes. Assuming you are purchasing themes online you have a number of places to look. Commercial theme shops are many and varied. There is also another type of commercial theme resource, typically referred to within the community as a <em>WordPress theme marketplace</em>.</p><p>After how well received our <a title=\"WordPress theme framework comparison\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/presents/wordpress-theme-framework-comparison\">WordPress theme framework comparison</a> was, and how often theme marketplaces were brought up when we discussed <a title=\"How to find WordPress themes\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/teaches/how-to-find-wordpress-themes-quickly-and-easily\">how to find WordPress themes</a>, there was just no way we couldn&#8217;t do a rundown of theme marketplaces as well. In this post you will find a bit of a background on theme marketplaces in general, a rundown of everyone we know about, and a poll so that you can weigh in with your experiences.</p><p><span id=\"more-17616\"></span></p><h3>What is a WordPress theme marketplace?</h3><p>WordPress theme marketplaces, as we define them here, are websites that offer commercial WordPress themes from at least a handful of different theme authors. In this way marketplaces are different than what we call theme <em>shops</em> or <em>vendors</em>, since shops offer themes from one single brand.</p><h3>Dedicated and assorted theme marketplaces</h3><p>Theme marketplaces can be broken down in two major groups: dedicated and assorted.</p><p>A <strong>dedicated</strong> theme marketplace is one that carries and sells only one type of template or theme. In our case, that type is WordPress. Dedicated theme marketplaces don&#8217;t offer any type of theme except for WordPress themes.</p><p>You might guess, then, that an <strong>assorted</strong> theme marketplace carries more than just one type of template. So while WordPress themes are included in all of the assorted theme marketplaces we list below, there are other kinds of themes and templates available there too.</p><h3>WordPress theme marketplace comparison table</h3><p>The following table is laid out in alphabetical order, as is the list below it.</p><table id=\"wp-table-reloaded-id-16-no-1\" class=\"wp-table-reloaded wp-table-reloaded-id-16\"><thead><tr class=\"row-1 odd\"><th class=\"column-1\"></th><th class=\"column-2\"><a href=\"http://www.mojo-themes.com/categories/wordpress/\" title=\"Mojo Themes WordPress theme marketplace\">Mojo Themes</a></th><th class=\"column-3\"><a href=\"http://themeforest.net/category/wordpress\" title=\"ThemeForest WordPress theme marketplace\">ThemeForest</a></th><th class=\"column-4\"><a href=\"http://www.themegarden.com/\" title=\"ThemeGarden WordPress theme marketplace\">ThemeGarden</a></th><th class=\"column-5\"><a href=\"http://wonderthemes.com/\" title=\"WonderThemes WordPress theme marketplace\">WonderThemes</a></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=\"row-2 even\"><td class=\"column-1\">Marketplace Type</td><td class=\"column-2\">Assorted</td><td class=\"column-3\">Assorted</td><td class=\"column-4\">Dedicated</td><td class=\"column-5\">Dedicated</td></tr><tr class=\"row-3 odd\"><td class=\"column-1\">Number of Themes</td><td class=\"column-2\">100+</td><td class=\"column-3\">900+</td><td class=\"column-4\">60+</td><td class=\"column-5\">Currently in beta</td></tr><tr class=\"row-4 even\"><td class=\"column-1\">Support Forum</td><td class=\"column-2\">Yes</td><td class=\"column-3\">Yes</td><td class=\"column-4\">No</td><td class=\"column-5\">Yes</td></tr><tr class=\"row-5 odd\"><td class=\"column-1\">Established</td><td class=\"column-2\">2010</td><td class=\"column-3\">2008</td><td class=\"column-4\">2010</td><td class=\"column-5\">2011</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>About Mojo Themes</h3><p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-17629\" title=\"Mojo Themes logo\" src=\"http://wpcandy.com/files/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-23-at-3.29.54-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"310\" height=\"88\" /></p><p>Mojo Themes came new to the WordPress community in early 2010, launched by friends of WPCandy JR Farr and Brady Nord.

WP4FB is a free WordPress template which is compatible with Facebook to use as an iFrame application, which in turn can be used as a tab at your fanpage. Using WP4FB its easy to set up your fanpage without using any coding skills, as its literally just as easy as WordPress blogging.</p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s an interesting idea. One of the coolest features to me is the ability to change what a Facebook user sees depending whether they&#8217;ve Liked the page or not. He calls it Fan Gate.</p><p>I do think it&#8217;s a bit odd to have a theme and WordPress blog with a sole purpose to create an iFrame for Facebook Fanpages. Maybe Facebook is making Fanpages a bit too hard.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you are like me and don&#8217;t want to manage an entirely separate blog for Facebook, I would install the theme in a subdomain using Multisite and use RSS to feed the site with my main blog&#8217;s content.</p><p>How would you use WP4FB?

Twenty Ten was designed to put on display key WordPress features, teach new beginning theme developers, and was named specifically to provide that extra push to developers to create Twenty Eleven while it was still <em>2011</em>.</p><p>Development on the next version of WordPress, version 3.2, is in full swing. With an update from project lead Matt Mullenweg just yesterday, 3.2 may bring with it a new default theme called, this time called Twenty Eleven. Mullenweg&#8217;s proposal is to improve and use <a title=\"Duster theme on WordPress.com\" href=\"http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/duster/\">Duster</a> as this new default theme. Duster, of course, is the theme that ThemeShaper adopted and adapted for <a title=\"ThemeShaper redesign and refocus, using Duster\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/reports/themeshaper-refocuses-as-the-automattic-theme-team-blog\">its redesign</a> back in February.</p><p>Mullenweg added the following to <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/17198\">his ticket</a> proposing Duster as the new basis for WordPress&#8217; default theme:</p><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s been a few years since we did this (#9015) but let&#8217;s track the effort for the TwentyEleven theme, hopefully making 3.2, here.</p><p>Main goals besides what we&#8217;ve already done in TwentyTen:</p><ul><li>To be different from TwentyTen, aesthetically.</li><li>Is a good showcase of WP&#8217;s headline features.</li><li>Clean, fast to load, and with best-practice markup.</li></ul><p>Some people will prefer the design of TwentyTen, which is still excellent, over TwentyEleven, but that&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;ll have something new next year.</p></blockquote><p>See the initial <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/17669\">changeset</a> for more info, and we&#8217;ll keep you posted on any updates we get. Assuming Duster becomes the next default, Twenty Eleven theme, what would you think? Is it a worthy successor to Twenty Ten?</p><p><span id=\"more-17459\"></span></p><p><em><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> This information is pulled from the <a title=\"WordPress Trac\" href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Trac</a>, which is about as early in the stages of planning/development as you can get. Well, except the mind itself. But until we can perfect our mind reading techniques here at WPCandy, which would undoubtedly increase the provocativeness of our blog posts, we have to rely on Trac tickets for early WordPress project movements.

Farr explained in the <a title=\"Mojo Themes 2011 redesign launch post\" href=\"http://www.mojo-themes.com/2011/04/new-mojo-and-anniversary-bundle/\">redesign launch post</a> that the design process took about three months of work to finish, and a number of variations:</p><blockquote><p>At the start of the creative direction and process, we would talk daily about ideas, looks, design styles, etc. and we went through a few weeks with a handful of variations. It was a draining but rewarding process and the full re-design process took close to 3 months to finish.  The old MOJO look was something we were proud of but we felt the time was right to essentially re-brand MOJO and set the standard. We feel like the current look represents us more as who we are and were excited for what the new site holds for us.</p></blockquote><p>The Mojo team built out the new site starting from a clean slate as well, focusing on a &#8220;rock-solid framework built solely around [their] users.&#8221; The redesign announcement also included mentions of yet to be released features like MOJO Social, alert notifications, and enhanced seller controls.</p><p>In addition to the redesign, Mojo is promoting an <a title=\"Mojo Themes Anniversary Bundle\" href=\"http://www.mojo-themes.com/bundles/anniversary/\">Anniversary Bundle</a> to celebrate their first year online. The bundle includes a number of WordPress themes, has a value of $442, and is available for only $25.</p><p>As we try to do <a title=\"WPCandy on big WordPress site redesigns\" href=\"http://wpcandy.com/series-on/big-wordpress-site-redesigns\">each time a big WordPress community site redesigns</a>, we have a comparison screenshot just after the jump.

The focus of a WordCamp is to foster face-to-face connections and collaboration among the local WordPress crowd, but there are usually some out-of-towners there as well. Here are the WordCamps that have been approved so far for the summer:</p>\n<p>April 16: <a href=\"http://wordcampseattle.org/\">WordCamp Seattle</a> in Seattle, WA. This weekend! After taking a year off, WordCamp Seattle is back with tracks for bloggers, designers, and developers. This year they&#8217;ll feature a lineup including presentations by both local speakers and visitors like core committer Andrew Nacin, as well as an Ignite session of lightning talks at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>May 5: <a href=\"http://wordcampdevelopers.com/\">WordCamp Vancouver (Developer Edition)</a> in Vancouver, BC. This one-day WordCamp is aimed purely at developers working on the WordPress platform, and will not have content aimed at bloggers (as previous Vancouver WordCamps have). I predict we will start seeing more of these types of niche WordCamps moving forward, because they will mean smaller, more intimate events that allow more collaboration (and make it easier to find venues!). Note that we&#8217;re working with the organizers to get the tickets to a more reasonable price, so keep your eyes open this week if you&#8217;ve held off on buying a ticket because of the price tag.</p>\n<p>May 7: <a href=\"http://wordcamp-switzerland.ch/\">WordCamp Switzerland</a> in Brugg, Switzerland. This one will cover a wide range of topics, including getting started with WordPress, advanced development topics, BuddyPress, and an inside look at running a WordPress-based business.</p>\n<p>May 14: <a href=\"http://www.ocwordcamp.com/\">WordCamp Orange County</a> in Orange, CA. Already sold out! Orange County had their first WordCamp last year, and the organizers have put together another great event this time around.</p>\n<p>May 14: <a href=\"http://paris14mai2011.wordcamp.fr/\">WordCamp Paris</a> in Paris, France. One of the last true unconference-style WordCamps, the Paris group will plan their schedule the morning of the event like they do at BarCamps. WordCamp Paris had one of the best WordCamp t-shirts ever a couple of years ago. And it&#8217;s in Paris in the spring.</p>\n<p>May 2122: <a href=\"http://wordcampraleigh.com/\">WordCamp Raleigh</a> in Raleigh, NC. Repeat organizers from the Raleigh WordPress Meetup Group are just starting to select speakers and put together their plans, but if it is anything like last year, the venue will be packed with WordPress professionals (and maybe there will be cookies). I&#8217;ll be attending this one, as will Nacin.</p>\n<p>June 45: <a href=\"http://2011.reno.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Reno-Lake Tahoe</a> in Reno, NV. Organized by a WordPress core UI group contributor, WordCamp Reno-Lake Tahoe is taking place in Reno and has a packed schedule full of visiting experts.</p>\n<p>June 1112: <a href=\"http://www.wckansascity.org/\">WordCamp Kansas City</a> in Overland Park, KS. With publisher, designer, and developer tracks, Kansas City&#8217;s WordCamp will have a little something for everyone, presented in large part by local speakers.</p>\n<p>June 1719: <a href=\"http://wordcampcolumbus.com/\">WordCamp Columbus</a> in Columbus, OH. WordCamp Columbus has a new organizer this year and is bringing the focus more firmly onto WordPress (and less on social media). Their 3-day event includes an entire day for newbies, and another for non-profits, a nice addition to the usual blogger/developer tracks.</p>\n<p>July 910: <a href=\"http://wcmtl.org/\">WordCamp Montreal</a> in Montreal, Quebec. This group consistently puts on a great every year. If you register now, you can still get a $10 discount and get both days for only $30 (with sessions in both English and French to reflect the bilingual nature of the city). Montreal plays host to a number of <a href=\"http://www.montreal.com/tourism/festivals/index.html\">festivals</a> throughout the year, and this weekend is no different, including festivals for the arts, comedy, tango, and even circus arts.</p>\n<p>July 16: <a href=\"http://2011.sandiego.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp San Diego</a> in San Diego, CA. First WordCamp in San Diego! They have talking about this for over a year, and are now starting to really ramp up the planning. They&#8217;re finalizing their venue right now, and I would expect a great roster of speakers.</p>\n<p>July 16-17: <a href=\"http://wiki.wordcampuk.org/Main_Page\">WordCamp Portsmouth</a> in Portsmouth, UK. The annual WordCamp UK that moves from city to city each year alights this year in Portsmouth. This one is notable because Mike Little, co-founder of WordPress, is part of the organizing team.</p>\n<p>July 2324: <a href=\"http://wordcampboston.com/\">WordCamp Boston</a> in Boston, MA. Another one just about to lock down some details and get starting with speaker selection, etc. An easy train ride from so many places, and not in the middle of winter this year!</p>\n<p>July 30-31: <a href=\"http://2011.chicago.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp Chicago</a> has new organizers and is a new venue this year. A call for speakers, supporters, and volunteers will likely be posted sometime next week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wordcampportland.org/\">WordCamp Portland</a> is looking for a venue before deciding on a date this year, as it has outgrown the space it&#8217;s used the past two years, but hopes to happen in September. If you would be interested in donating a venue to this popular event, please <a href=\"http://www.wordcampportland.org/\">contact them</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll hold off on posting fall events until later in the summer since there a lot in the planning stages now.

We&#8217;ll also have a limited supply of the special WordPress/Texas shirts that we&#8217;ll be giving away at the booth, so if you&#8217;re at SxSW between now and Thursday, stop by.  Hope to see you there!</p>\n<p><em>Location: The WordPress booth will be in trade show stand numbers 829, 831, 928, and 930 (it&#8217;s an endcap booth that combines those four spaces). You can find us in those spaces by following the numbered banners hanging from the ceiling.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/03/sxsw2011/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 3.1, lots of fun\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/02/threeone/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2011/02/threeone/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 14:00:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=1704\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:388:\"The long-awaited fourteenth release of WordPress is now available.

Version 3.1 is <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">available for download</a>, or you can <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Updates_SubPanel\">update from within your dashboard</a>.</p>\n<p>This release features a lightning fast <strong>redesigned linking workflow</strong> which makes it easy to link to your existing posts and pages, an <strong>admin bar</strong> so you&#8217;re never more than a click away from your most-used dashboard pages, a <strong>streamlined writing interface</strong> that hides many of the seldom-used panels by default to create a simpler and less intimidating writing experience for new bloggers (visit Screen Options in the top right to get old panels back), and a <strong>refreshed blue admin scheme</strong> available for selection under your personal options.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a bucket of candy for developers as well, including our new <strong>Post Formats support</strong> which makes it easy for themes to create portable tumblelogs with different styling for different types of posts, <strong>new CMS capabilities</strong> like archive pages for custom content types, a <strong>new Network Admin</strong>, an overhaul of the import and export system, and the ability to perform<strong> advanced taxonomy and custom fields queries</strong>.</p>\n<p>With the 3.1 release, <strong>WordPress is more of a CMS than ever before</strong>. The only limit to what you can build is your imagination.</p>\n<p>(No video yet for 3.1, we&#8217;re going to add it later.)</p>\n<h3>By the Numbers</h3>\n<p>There were over <strong>two thousand commits</strong> to the codebase in the 3.1 cycle! For a more comprehensive look at everything that has improved in 3.1, check out <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.1\">3.1s Codex page</a> or the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&#38;resolution=fixed&#38;milestone=3.1&#38;group=status&#38;desc=1&#38;order=priority\">more than 820 closed issues in Trac</a>.</p>\n<p>Now is the time to drop by our development channels if you are interested in being involved with 3.2, as the agenda will be under discussion shortly. We&#8217;re hoping to get the 3.2 release out in a shorter development cycle (3.1 took too long) and include some fun improvements around plugins and the speed of the admin. (Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re still planning <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\">on using PHP</a>.)</p>\n<h3>We&#8217;re All in This Together</h3>\n<p>WordPress is the result of the combined effort of people from all over the world united with a common goal: to make the best darn web software for publishing your story on the web and sharing it with the world.

If you attempt to leverage new components of the API, you are pretty much guaranteeing that your plugins will break in a future release, so please don&#8217;t do that. <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':-)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' />  We hope to enable all the fun new goodies for public use in a future release.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the only way we could prevent any regressions in functionality and usability from WordPress 3.0 to 3.1. That&#8217;s right, users and plugin authors can still do everything you used to be able to do (and a little bit more).</p>\n<p>Because of the code churn between RC2 and RC3, <strong>this release candidate needs a lot of testing</strong>. Every list screen needs testing. In particular, the comment moderation screen needs testing, especially with keyboard shortcuts (if you didn&#8217;t know about those, now&#8217;s your chance to try them out).</p>\n<p>Other fixes in RC3 include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly display the author dropdown in Quick Edit</li>\n<li>Various important fixes to numerous taxonomy query variables</li>\n<li>Fixes to the theme deletion process</li>\n<li>Fixes to pages used for posts</li>\n<li>IIS and Multisite: Avoid resetting web.config on permalink save</li>\n<li>Properly validate post formats and their rewrite rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m assembling a group of friends in Washington, D.C., this weekend to test WordPress 3.1 and provide feedback. We&#8217;d love to see this idea catch on among friends at coffee shops around the world. (We&#8217;ll blog our results, and we&#8217;re thinking about using the hashtag #wptest on Twitter.) If you are testing the release candidate and think you&#8217;ve found a bug, there are a few ways to let us know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post it to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a></li>\n<li>Report it to the <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers\">wp-testers mailing list</a></li>\n<li>Join the development IRC channel and tell us live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev</li>\n<li>File a bug ticket on the <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Trac</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.1, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (you&#8217;ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;).

Kundan Meena jewelry pieces have encrusted gemstones on one side and smooth decorated colored surfaces on the other. This kind of jewelry making involves setting a precious stone such as a diamond, sapphire or ruby on its mount using a gold foil.\n\nMost of the intricate Kundan Meena jewelry is made by skilled artisans, which adds to the value of the pieces. The designs are simple yet aesthetic, consisting of simple geometric patterns to more elaborate embellishments. One standout feature of most Kundan Meena jewelry pieces is that they are colorful and eye-catching. Regardless of whether a precious or semi-precious gem is used, the finished product looks beautiful and sophisticated.\n\n<strong>How Kundan Meena jewelry is made</strong>\n\nThe process of Kundan Meena jewelry making first involves preparing the gold foil. The gold is made soft and malleable after passing it through a rolling machine that churns out flat sheets of 22 carat. The resulting gold sheet is hammered and beaten to get the required thickness.\n\nAfter the soft gold sheet is ready, the artisans carve the desired gold design with their hands or using tweezers. The resulting pattern forms the outer walls of the finished jewelry piece. The number of designs that have to be carved out depend on the type and size of the piece under making. After the gold designs have been fashioned out of the gold foil, they are bonded or soldered together to form the final shape of the jewelry piece. The soldering is done traditionally by puffing fire out of pipes onto the gold pieces and combining them into one solid piece, such as an earring or a necklace.\n\nThe black residue on the jewelry piece after the soldering process is cleaned using mild chemicals and then dried. After this, the piece is handed over to the gem setter. In gem setting, first the lac is heated and poured into the creek, which is supposed to hold the gem. Meanwhile the gem or stone that has to be encrusted is prepared. A gold or silver foil is fixed to the back of the gem to make it gleam. The gemstones are now placed into the creeks or holders.\n\nIn the final step, the bits of 24 carat gold foils or kundan are set into the sides of the gemstones till they grip on tightly. In the Meenakari process, which is intricate and laborious, enamel colors are added to the jewelry piece through an engraving and fusing technique.\n\nEvery Indian bride dreams of wearing a one-of-a-kind Kundan Meena jewelry set these days. After exquisite Kundan Meena pieces worn by Aishwarya Rai in the Bollywood epic Jodha Akbar caught the publics fancy, many jewelry showrooms in India have seen a rise in sales of Kundan Meena jewelry. Traditional handcrafted jewelry such as Kundan Meena has been cherished for centuries in India and is now finding popularity world over.\n\nNote:This is an article  by the nethaat team and no part of it can be copied/reproduced without permission","Making of Kundan Meena Jewelry","This writeup tells in details about one of the very popular and traditional jewelry art in India","publish","open","open","","making-of-kundan-meena-jewelry","","","2011-02-01 15:00:41","2011-02-01 15:00:41","","0","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=52","0","post","","1");

Kundan Meena jewelry pieces have encrusted gemstones on one side and smooth decorated colored surfaces on the other. This kind of jewelry making involves setting a precious stone such as a diamond, sapphire or ruby on its mount using a gold foil.\n\nMost of the intricate Kundan Meena jewelry is made by skilled artisans, which adds to the value of the pieces. The designs are simple yet aesthetic, consisting of simple geometric patterns to more elaborate embellishments. One standout feature of most Kundan Meena jewelry pieces is that they are colorful and eye-catching. Regardless of whether a precious or semi-precious gem is used, the finished product looks beautiful and sophisticated.\n\n <strong>How Kundan Meena jewelry is made</strong>\n\nThe process of Kundan Meena jewelry making first involves preparing the gold foil. The gold is made soft and malleable after passing it through a rolling machine that churns out flat sheets of 22 carat. The resulting gold sheet is hammered and beaten to get the required thickness.\n\nAfter the soft gold sheet is ready, the artisans carve the desired gold design with their hands or using tweezers. The resulting pattern forms the outer walls of the finished jewelry piece. The number of designs that have to be carved out depend on the type and size of the piece under making. After the gold designs have been fashioned out of the gold foil, they are bonded or soldered together to form the final shape of the jewelry piece. The soldering is done traditionally by puffing fire out of pipes onto the gold pieces and combining them into one solid piece, such as an earring or a necklace.\n\nThe black residue on the jewelry piece after the soldering process is cleaned using mild chemicals and then dried. After this, the piece is handed over to the gem setter. In gem setting, first the lac is heated and poured into the creek, which is supposed to hold the gem. Meanwhile the gem or stone that has to be encrusted is prepared. A gold or silver foil is fixed to the back of the gem to make it gleam. The gemstones are now placed into the creeks or holders.\n\n In the final step, the bits of 24 carat gold foils or kundan are set into the sides of the gemstones till they grip on tightly. In the Meenakari process, which is intricate and laborious, enamel colors are added to the jewelry piece through an engraving and fusing technique.\n\n \n\nEvery Indian bride dreams of wearing a one-of-a-kind Kundan Meena jewelry set these days. After exquisite Kundan Meena pieces worn by Aishwarya Rai in the Bollywood epic Jodha Akbar caught the publics fancy, many jewelry showrooms in India have seen a rise in sales of Kundan Meena jewelry.

They are a bit boring and old fashioned and are rarely used. We are reluctant to throw them to avoid being wasteful, but in the end they are just old shoes piling up in our house.\n\n \n\nDo you have a pair of old shoes?\n\nDo you want to glam up your shoes?\n\nDo you want to give them a new birth?\n\n \n\nIf you just said \'yes\', then here we go-\n\nWith the following tips and tricks you can convert your old, granny shoes into glam shoes instantly. Or you can make previously unsuitable shoes match your new outfit. Or you can make one pair of shoes seem like several. From beautiful to fashionable, elaborating your shoes can be easy with the following simple ways.\n\nThe first step of your artsy mission is to acquire the ingredients. You just need some clip findings, ribbons, beads, lace, faux pearls, silk or paper flowers, clip on shoe accessories, rhinestones, cabochons and other tiny trinkets and don\'t forget contact cement and bobby pins to secure these things on your shoes.\n\nAfter you gather all bits and bytes you can, make your designs. Keep your designs simple. Just don\'t paste all stuff on one pair of shoes. Try to make different design with different color combinations for different pairs. However, you can have the same design for both the shoes of the same pair.\n\nThere are many ways to design simple tidbits. You can make a tailored bow (actually a pair would be better) from ribbons or you can give a romantic touch by affixing lace, a strand of faux pearls or delicate beaded trim around the opening of sandals. You can use studded rhinestones to attach the lace to add glitzy touch. You can also give a spring look to your sandals by affixing silk or paper flowers or butterflies and sea shells and more.\n\nEvery design doesnt have to be elegant. You can decorate as casually as you want. You can also use fabric paint designs on your shoes. Design making needs a lot of practice and once you are on you\'ll become better and better with time. Once you\'ve had a little practice you\'ll have the most extensive shoe wardrobe of anyone you know.\n\nWith this level of creativity your shoes can transform into customized, engaging compliments to your personality. You can also turn a pair of cheap pumps or flats into refined accessories for you ensembles, so you should learn to decorate your plain shoes to get the great look you desire. The next time you\'re considering a new pair of shoes thinks instead of redecorating a pair you already own and impress your friends with your creativity.","Getting creative with your old shoes","","publish","open","open","","getting-creative-with-your-old-shoes","","","2011-02-20 14:41:13","2011-02-20 14:41:13","","0","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=103","0","post","","0");

The increasing number of orders is good news indeed, especially coming after a bad recessive year, when the buyers for handmade Indian crafts significantly dropped. But a serious dearth of skilled workers is threatening the industrys growth prospects.

Kundan Meena jewelry pieces have encrusted gemstones on one side and smooth decorated colored surfaces on the other. This kind of jewelry making involves setting a precious stone such as a diamond, sapphire or ruby on its mount using a gold foil.\n\nMost of the intricate Kundan Meena jewelry is made by skilled artisans, which adds to the value of the pieces. The designs are simple yet aesthetic, consisting of simple geometric patterns to more elaborate embellishments. One standout feature of most Kundan Meena jewelry pieces is that they are colorful and eye-catching. Regardless of whether a precious or semi-precious gem is used, the finished product looks beautiful and sophisticated.\n\n<strong>How Kundan Meena jewelry is made</strong>\n\nThe process of Kundan Meena jewelry making first involves preparing the gold foil. The gold is made soft and malleable after passing it through a rolling machine that churns out flat sheets of 22 carat. The resulting gold sheet is hammered and beaten to get the required thickness.\n\nAfter the soft gold sheet is ready, the artisans carve the desired gold design with their hands or using tweezers. The resulting pattern forms the outer walls of the finished jewelry piece. The number of designs that have to be carved out depend on the type and size of the piece under making. After the gold designs have been fashioned out of the gold foil, they are bonded or soldered together to form the final shape of the jewelry piece. The soldering is done traditionally by puffing fire out of pipes onto the gold pieces and combining them into one solid piece, such as an earring or a necklace.\n\nThe black residue on the jewelry piece after the soldering process is cleaned using mild chemicals and then dried. After this, the piece is handed over to the gem setter. In gem setting, first the lac is heated and poured into the creek, which is supposed to hold the gem. Meanwhile the gem or stone that has to be encrusted is prepared. A gold or silver foil is fixed to the back of the gem to make it gleam. The gemstones are now placed into the creeks or holders.\n\nIn the final step, the bits of 24 carat gold foils or kundan are set into the sides of the gemstones till they grip on tightly. In the Meenakari process, which is intricate and laborious, enamel colors are added to the jewelry piece through an engraving and fusing technique.\n\nEvery Indian bride dreams of wearing a one-of-a-kind Kundan Meena jewelry set these days. After exquisite Kundan Meena pieces worn by Aishwarya Rai in the Bollywood epic Jodha Akbar caught the publics fancy, many jewelry showrooms in India have seen a rise in sales of Kundan Meena jewelry. Traditional handcrafted jewelry such as Kundan Meena has been cherished for centuries in India and is now finding popularity world over.","Making of Kundan Meena Jewelry","This writeup tells in details about one of the very popular and traditional jewelry art in India","inherit","open","open","","52-revision-17","","","2011-01-28 13:40:58","2011-01-28 13:40:58","","52","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=84","0","revision","","0");

Your companion will love you for being so thoughtful in your choice of a Valentine\'s gift and may even boast about it to friends and family members!\n\n Hand made items are an expression of the designer\'s creativity. They are exclusive and make unique gifts. The hand sewn kurta or delicately crafted photo frame you present to your loved one will be a one-of-a-kind piece he/she will cherish forever. There is no doubting the fact that an attractive hand-made item will grab more eyeballs than the typical Valentine\'s Day gift from a known consumer brand. In fact, you may be surprised how many of your colleagues and friends may have gifted their companions the same gifts you bought from your city\'s popular mall. Make Valentine\'s Day more about appreciating your loved one with a gift fraught with value and meaning than just buying him/her the most advertised V-day product in showrooms.\n\n <strong>For Her</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong><strong>Hand made jewellery: </strong>Jewellery is a great choice for women of all ages.  You can choose gold plated earrings, antique Kundan Meena jewellery or the more contemporary hand crafted earrings and necklaces that your loved one can wear to casual or formal occasions. You can opt for beaded, sequined and heavily embellished jewellery or minimalist designs, based on your wife/girlfriend\'s preferences.\n\n<strong> </strong><strong>Hand sewn kurtas: </strong>If your companion is a fashionista, add some sparkle to her wardrobe by gifting her a hand woven kurta. Most of these kurtas come in eco friendly dyes, so your loved can make an eco friendly statement as well.\n\n <strong>For Him</strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>It is always difficult shopping for a man. There just arent enough gift options to choose from. Wallets and watches have become passé. Unlike women, most men dont get excited over clothes and accessories. A common yet meaningful gift is a beautifully embellished photo frame with a picture of you and your companion. When the photo frame is hand-made, its value is all the more enhanced. Hand made paper diaries, though not exactly romantic, can also serve as a useful gift for your husband.\n\n Surprise your companion with a hand crafted gift and earn brownie points.

However, there are many master craftsmen in India who still favour the use of traditional tools such as chisels, saws and hammers to create truly unique wooden decorative pieces.\n\nOne of the main reasons why wooden handicrafts continue to hold their strong position in the decorative items market is that they are resilient and easy to maintain. These items can be transported even across countries without a single scratch marring the finish.

A drab, colourless room can be transformed into an elegant area by using the right kind of wood decorative pieces.\n\nThere is a huge range of options to choose from when you want a wooden decorative piece to brighten up your home or office. An intricately carved wooden frame can be used to showcase a simple painting. A wood carved representation of an object or a well known figure can lend a personal touch to a room or shift focus of beholders to a specific theme. For example, a shipping business may have an elaborate carved ship in its reception area.\n\nWood has been the favoured material for hundreds of artisans because of its versatility and it will continue to grace the homes and offices of many across the world for ages to come.

Later, the technique also found its way to India,Europe and other places across the world. Wooden blocks were the most commonly used implements to make these designs although some craftsmen also used porcelain or metal blocks. Block printing is a highly labour intensive task and requires meticulous care from the craftsman. But once completed, the fabric gains an elegance and splendour that is rarely matched by another design form.</div>\n \n\nIn India, hand block printing from Rajasthan has been very popular and mostly named by the prints and motif styles  as sanganeri  and bagru prints named after the towns in Rajasthan where they originated. The technique of hand block is finding popularity on various forms of cloths like Cotton, silks, georgette etc and is being used in various innovative ways in fashion circuit.\n\nThe Sanganeri hand block printed textile products from Rajasthan have been awarded Geographical Indication (GI) Status that will protect it from being duplicated anywhere else. This status allows some 300 producers of the sanganer region to take legal action against the infringement of the name of their product. The screen printed textiles in Rajasthan which are sold in the name of sanganeri will now be illegal\n\nAlthough hand block printing was very common in olden days before machines made designing so simple and fast; in recent past, not many of these fabric prints were to be found in the fashion circles. However, this printing form seems to be making a spectacular comeback if the recent Fashion Weeks are any measure of current trends.\n\n<strong>Hand block printing in the fashion world</strong>\n\nWell known designer Ritu Kumar gets the credit for revitalising hand block printing and for bringing back interest to this age old fabric art form. Kumar started small with a vision to bring Indias best to the world stage. She had a couple of hand block printers in a small fabric design studio in Calcutta when she first made her entry into the world of fashion design about 30 years back. Today, both Ritu Kumar and hand block printing have carved a niche for themselves in Indian and international fashion.\n\nThe recent display of hand block printed saris and suits by Chaitali Biplab at the Blenders Price Bangalore Fashion Week showed that there are many others who are willing to hold the flame of Indian fabric hand block printing aloft. The back to basics trend that is sweeping through the fashion world is, no doubt, contributing to the impetus that traditional fabric design forms are now beginning to enjoy.\n\n<strong>The appeal of these fabrics</strong>\n\nSubtle shades of colour, traditional materials like crisp cottons, stunning silks or even jute embellished with intricate block printed designs make a stunning formal or casual ensemble. Designers are increasingly using this potent combination to create apparel that is ideally suited for the Indian climate as well as the Indian complexion.\n\nOne thing is very clear from all of this.

It represents the amazing ability of human beings to express them. With a pencil and piece of paper, one can craft out incredible masterpieces. Some people are naturally gifted; they are born to draw, while others struggle with simple line drawings.

Art, any form of it, takes patience, practice and perseverance. Drawing is no exception. If you want to draw better then you should draw everyday. Mastering any art takes sweat, so practice. Procrastination is your biggest enemy at this stage and it will try to hold you as prisoner.

Draw when you are sitting idle. Draw instead of watching television, its more productive.\n\nAs soon as you train yourself to draw anytime- anywhere, move on to next step- draw from life. Draw the things you see instead of drawing from their photographs. If you live in Paris, go to Eiffel tower and draw it instead of drawing pyramids. Just get out of your house and observe nature as it is. Go to some park or coffee shop or any other place where you expect to find people. Initially draw live sketches of inanimate objects and then move on to draw the people as they stand in line to pay or disorganized on a platform while boarding trains.\n\nAfter you have practiced rough sketches, move to permanent. Painting with inks and other permanent media burns down your option to erase when things go wrong but it is an important step if you want to improve your sketching skills. You can learn to drive a car in your neighborhood with less traffic around, but if you are planning to go to work with it- you must practice it in traffic (though only after learning to drive). This is what we are trying to do here, giving you the confidence to draw without having to erase. At first, you will be shy and draw carefully measured lines since you have just lost your ability to erase. But very soon you will lose your internal fear of drawing wrong lines. You will start focusing more on your subject and less on perfecting the lines, just as you focus on street and don\'t search for breaks once you have learned to drive.\n\nAfter your strokes grow bolder you can focus on some refining skills to make your drawings even better. You should try to draw with your non-drawing hand in order to enhance your focus. You should study anatomy to improve your skill level. The knowledge of person\'s build, skeletal structure and joints will help you while drawing people as well as animals. You should look at your subjects as geometrical shapes- square, rectangle, circle etc. this will give you the power to draw fast. Also draw same objects in different poses or angles to enhance your perception of depth.\n\nGiving finishing touch to your skills practice on works by masters. Redrawing works of Picasso, Michelangelo and daVinci will help you more and you will understand the bigger challenges.

Also draw same objects in different poses or angles to enhance your perception of depth.\n\n Giving finishing touch to your skills practice on works by masters. Redrawing works of Picasso, Michelangelo and daVinci will help you more and you will understand the bigger challenges. Happy drawing.","Ways to improve your drawing skills","","inherit","open","open","","158-revision-2","","","2011-04-03 03:35:32","2011-04-03 03:35:32","","158","http://www.nethaat.com/blog/?p=162","0","revision","","0");
